This sensitivity has been interpreted as evidence for phase perception in bats at ultrasonic frequencies. An alternative interpretation of the data, however, does not depend upon phase perception. The observed sensitivity to autocorrelation fine structure can be explained by a process that involves cross correlation of filtered spectrograms.

A heron plunging its head underwater to skewer a fish must correct for light refraction, an archerfish shooting down an insect must ``consider'' gravity, and an echolocating bat that is attacking prey must account for the speed of sound in order to assess its distance. Do animals learn these relations or are they encoded innately and can they adjust them as adults are all open questions. We addressed this question by shifting the speed of sound and assessing the sensory behavior of a bat species that naturally experiences different speeds of sound. We found that both newborn pups and adults are unable to adjust to this shift, suggesting that the speed of sound is innately encoded in the bat brain. Moreover, our results suggest that bats encode the world in terms of time and do not translate time into distance. Our results shed light on the evolution of innate and flexible sensory perception.},

Principal-components analysis separated desmodontines, brachyphyllines, glossophagines, and another group composed of the stenodermatines, carolliines, and phyllostomines. The first two principal components showed that noseleaf variables can be grouped by size of the horseshoe and size of the spear. Forearm length (a measure of body size) was correlated with general size of the noseleaf, spear size, and horseshoe size, but the correlation was strongest with the last feature, indicating that the spear is a more variable element that may depend on the ecology of the animal. A canonical discriminant analysis failed to separate stenodermatines from phyllostomines. However, it demonstrated an association between feeding habits and noseleaf morphology by creating a derived variable significantly correlated with feeding habits but not with body size among phyllostomines.},

Contributions of external ear structures to directional features of the transfer functions were examined by remeasuring the HRTF in the absence of the pinna and tragus. The investigation mainly focused on the interactions between the spatial and the spectral features in the bat HRTF. The pinna provides gain and shapes these features over a large frequency band (20-90 kHz), and the tragus contributes gain and directionality at the high frequencies (60 to 90 kHz). Analysis of the spatial and spectral characteristics of the bat HRTF reveals that both interaural level differences (ILD) and monaural spectral features are subject to changes in sound source azimuth and elevation. Consequently, localization cues for horizontal and vertical components of the sound source location interact. Availability of multiple cues about sound source azimuth and elevation should enhance information to support reliable sound localization. These findings stress the importance of the acoustic information received at the two ears for sound localization of sonar target position in both azimuth and elevation.},

We asked how the auditory system accesses spatial information in the dimensions of azimuth and elevation with a sensory apparatus that is fundamentally different from vision. We quantified echoacoustic parameters of surface-wave patterns with impulse-response recordings and quantified bats' perceptual sensitivity to such patterns with formal psychophysics. We demonstrate that the spectro-temporal auditory representation of a wave pattern implicitly encodes its spatial frequency. We further show that bats are much more sensitive to wave patterns of high spatial frequencies than of low spatial frequencies. We conclude that echo-imaging accesses spatial information by exploiting an inherent environmental high-pass filter for spatial frequency. The functional similarities yet mechanistic differences between visual and auditory system signify convergent evolution of spatial-information processing.},

The echolocation call of frequency-modulating bats (FM bats) typically sweeps through a broad range of frequencies within a few milliseconds. The large bandwidth grants the bat high spatial acuity in depicting the target. However, the extremely short call duration and the overall low duty cycle of call emission impair the bat's capability to detect e.g. target movement. Nonetheless, FM bats constitute more than 80\% of all echolocating species and are able to navigate and forage in an environment full of moving targets. We used an auditory virtual reality approach to generate changes in echo amplitude reflective of fluttering insect wings independently from other confounding parameters. We show that the FM bat Phyllostomus discolor successfully detected these modulations in echo amplitude and that their performance increased with the rate of the modulation, mimicking faster insect wing-beats. The ability of FM bats to detect amplitude modulations of echoes suggests a release from the trade-off between spatial and temporal acuity and highlights the diversity of selective pressures working on the echolocation system of bats.},

Perception of delay modulations has been studied extensively in bats, but only concerning how well bats discriminate flutter frequencies, never with regard to flutter magnitude. We used an auditory virtual reality approach to generate changes in echo delay that were independent of call repetition rate, mimicking fluttering insect wings. We show that in the frequency-modulating (FM) bat Phyllostomus discolor, the sensitivity for modulations in echo delay depends on the rate of the modulation, with bats being most sensitive at modulation rates below 20 Hz and above 50 Hz. The very short duration of their calls compels FM bats to evaluate slow modulations ({$<$} about 100 Hz) across entire echo sequences. This makes them susceptible to interference between their own call repetition rate and the modulation rate. We propose that this phenomenon constitutes an echo-acoustic wagon-wheel effect. We further demonstrate how at high modulation rates, flutter sensitivity could be rescued by using spectral and temporal cues introduced by Doppler distortions. Thus, Doppler distortions may play a crucial role in flutter sensitivity in the hundreds of FM species worldwide.},

  abstract = {In bats, the directivity patterns of the biosonar system are shaped by the surface geometry of the pinnae. Since many bat species are capable of large ear deformations, these beampatterns can be time-variant. To investigate this time-variance using numerical methods, a digital model that is capable of representing the pinna geometry during the entire deformation cycle has been developed. Due to large deformations and occlusions, some of the surfaces relevant to sound diffraction may not be visible and hence the geometry of the entire pinna has to be computed from limited data. This has been achieved by combining a complete digital model of the pinna in one position with time-variant sparse sets of three dimensional landmark data. The landmark positions were estimated using stereo vision methods. A finite element model based on elasticity was constructed from CT scans of the pinna post mortem. This elastic model was deformed to provide a good fit to the positions of the landmarks and retain values of smoothness and surface energy comparable to life. This model was able to handle ratios of data to degrees of freedom around 1:5000 and still effect life-like deformations with an acceptable goodness of fit.}

Indeed, it is often considered one of the markers of objective scientific inquiry. Peer review is so central to the way science works that many observers assume that, like modern science, the system had its origins in the Scientific Revolution of the seventeenth century. That turns out not to be the case. In fact, the ``referee system'' did not exist before the nineteenth century and the term ``peer review'' was a creation of the late twentieth century. Furthermore, systems of review were not intended to be a mark of scientific legitimacy; that expectation only arose during the Cold War.

Here, we report results from a long-term study across the globe, assaying moth response to playback of bat echolocation. We tested 252 genera, spanning most families of large-bodied moths, and document anti-bat ultrasound production in 52 genera, with eight subfamily origins described. Based on acoustic analysis of ultrasonic emissions and palatability experiments with bats, it seems that acoustic warning and mimicry are the raison d'\^etre for sound production in most moths. However, some moths use high-duty-cycle ultrasound capable of jamming bat sonar. In fact, we find preliminary evidence of independent origins of sonar jamming in at least six subfamilies. Palatability data indicate that jamming and warning are not mutually exclusive strategies. To explore the possible organization of anti-bat warning sounds into acoustic mimicry rings, we intensively studied a community of moths in Ecuador and, using machine-learning approaches, found five distinct acoustic clusters. While these data represent an early understanding of acoustic aposematism and mimicry across this megadiverse insect order, it is likely that ultrasonically signaling moths comprise one of the largest mimicry complexes on earth.},

Obstacles in a two-dimensional (2-D) environment are detected and localized using time-of-flight (TOF) measurements of their echoes. The standard threshold detector produces a biased TOF estimate. An unbiased TOF estimate is derived by a parametric fit to the echo waveform, motivated by our experimental observations of actual sonar signals. This novel method forms a trade-off between the complexity of the optimum estimator and the biased threshold detector. Using the TOF information from both methods, the range and azimuth of an obstacle are estimated. Localization is most accurate if the obstacle is located along the system line-of-sight and improves with decreasing range. Standard deviations of the range and azimuth estimators are compared to the CramCr-Rao lower bounds. The parabolic fit method has large variance but zero bias at large deviations from the line-of-sight. The system operation is generalized from isolated obstacles to extended obstacles.},

Because the second harmonic is beamed more weakly to the sides than the first harmonic, these clutter echoes have a weaker second harmonic. In psychophysical experiments, we found that electronically misaligning first and second harmonics in echoes (to mimic the misalignment of corresponding neural responses to harmonics in clutter echoes) disrupts the bat's echo-delay perception but also prevents clutter masking. Electronically offsetting harmonics to realign their neural responses restores delay perception but also clutter interference. Thus, bats exploit harmonics to distinguish clutter echoes from target echoes, sacrificing delay acuity to suppress masking.},

For orientation, bats rely on broadcasted calls and they must assign each echo to the corresponding call. When bats orient in acoustically enriched environments, call-echo assignment becomes challenging due to signal interference. Bats often adapt echolocation parameters which potentially improves signal extraction. However, they also adjust echolocation parameters with respect to target distance. To characterize adaptations that are exclusively elicited to minimize signal interference, we tested the effect of acoustic playback on the echolocation behavior of the fruit-eating bat, Carollia perspicillata . Hereby, distance-dependent changes were considered by swinging bats in a pendulum and directly measuring the object distance. Acoustic playback evoked different call adjustments in parameters such as bandwidth, peak-frequency, duration and call level. These adaptations were highly dynamic and could vary across individuals, days, trials, and even within trials. Our results demonstrate that bats do not only change one echolocation parameter when orienting in acoustically enriched environments. They rather have a tool-kit of different behavioral adaptations to cope with interfering acoustic stimuli. By dynamically switching between different adaptations, bats can maximize the extraction of their biosonar signals from the background.},

However, we discovered that this click-based echo sensing is rudimentary and does not allow these bats to estimate distance accurately as all other echolocating bats can. Moreover, unlike all other echolocating bats, which generate pulses using the larynx or the tongue, these bats generated clicks with their wings. We provide evidence suggesting that all Old World fruit bats can click with their wings.

  abstract = {The directionality of bat echolocation calls defines the width of bats' sonar ``view,'' while call intensity directly influences detection range since adequate sound energy must impinge upon objects to return audible echoes. Both are thus crucial parameters for understanding biosonar signal design. Phyllostomid bats have been classified as low intensity or ``whispering bats,'' but recent data indicate that this designation may be inaccurate. Echolocation beam directionality in phyllostomids has only been measured through electrode brain-stimulation of restrained bats, presumably excluding active beam control via the noseleaf. Here, a 12-microphone array was used to measure echolocation call intensity and beam directionality in the frugivorous phyllostomid, Carollia perspicillata, echolocating in flight. The results showed a considerably narrower beam shape (half-amplitude beam angles of approximately 16\textdegree{} horizontally and 14\textdegree{} vertically) and louder echolocation calls [source levels averaging 99 dB sound pressure level (SPL) root mean square] for C. perspicillata than was found for this species when stationary. This suggests that naturally behaving phyllostomids shape their sound beam to achieve a longer and narrower sonar range than previously thought. C. perspicillata orient and forage in the forest interior and the narrow beam might be adaptive in clutter, by reducing the number and intensity of off-axis echoes.},

We reveal how different acoustic dimensions, specifically echo intensity and sonar aperture (or width), are important for correct perception by echolocating bats. We flew bats down a corridor blocked by objects with different intensity\textendash aperture combinations. To our surprise, bats crashed straight into large (aperture) walls with weak echo intensity as if they did not exist. The echolocation behavior of the bats indicated that they did detect the wall, suggesting that crashing was not a result of limited sensory sensitivity, but of a perceptual deficit. We systematically manipulated intensity and aperture by changing the materials and width of different reflectors, and we conclude that a coherent echo-based percept is created only when these two acoustic dimensions have certain relations which are typical for objects in nature (e.g., large and intense or small and weak reflectors). Nevertheless, we show that these preferred relations are not innate. We show that young pups are not constrained to these relations and that new intensity\textendash aperture associations can also be learned by adult bats.},

From the calculated HRTF results, binaural interaural intensity differences (IIDs) are derived. The results: Region of highest sensitivity, HRTF patterns, and IID patterns are shown to be in good agreement with earlier experimental measurements on other specimens of the same bat species, i.e., the differences are within the interspecies variability range. Next, it is argued that the proposed simulation method offers distinct advantages over acoustic measurements on real bat specimens. To illustrate this, it is shown how computer manipulation of the virtual morphology model allows a more detailed comprehension of bat spatial hearing by investigating the effects of different head parts on the HRTF. From this analysis it is concluded that for this species the pinna has a significantly larger effect on the HRTF and IID patterns than the head itself. This conclusion argues in favor of a series of recent simulation studies based on pinna morphology only [R. M\"uller, J. Acoust. Soc.

  abstract = {Bat wing morphology is considered in relation to flight performance and flight behaviour to clarify the functional basis for eco-morphological correlations in flying animals. Bivariate correlations are presented between wing dimensions and body mass for a range of bat families and feeding classes, and principal-components analysis is used to measure overall size, wing size and wing shape. The principal components representing wing size and wing shape (as opposed to overall size) are interpreted as being equivalent to wing loading and to aspect ratio. Relative length and area of the hand-wing or wingtip are determined independently of wing size, and are used to derive a wingtip shape index, which measures the degree of roundedness or pointedness of the wingtip. The optimal wing form for bats adapted for different modes of flight is predicted by means of mechanical and aerodynamic models. We identify and model aspects of performance likely to influence flight adaptation significantly; these include selective pressures for economic forward flight (low energy per unit time or per unit distance (equal to cost of transport)), for flight at high or low speeds, for hovering, and for turning. "Turning performance is measured by two quantities: manoeuvrability, referring to the minimum space required for a turn at a given speed; and agility, relating to the rate at which a turn can be initiated. High flight speed correlates with high wing loading, good manoeuvrability is favoured by low wing loading, and turning agility should be associated with fast flight and with high wing loading. Other factors influencing wing adaptations, such as migration, flying with a foetus or young or carrying loads in flight (all of which favour large wing area), flight in cluttered environments (short wings) and modes of landing, are identified. The mechanical predictions are cast into a size-independent principal-components form, and are related to the morphology and the observed flight behaviour of different species and families of bats. In this way we provide a broadly based functional interpretation of the selective forces that influence wing morphology in bats. Measured flight speeds in bats permit testing of these predictions. Comparison of open-field free-flight speeds with morphology confirms that speed correlates with mass, wing loading and wingtip proportions as expected; there is no direct relation between speed and aspect ratio. Some adaptive trends in bat wing morphology are clear from this analysis. Insectivores hunt in a range of different ways, which are reflected in their morphology. Bats hawking high-flying insects have small, pointed wings which give good agility, high flight speeds and low cost of transport. Bats hunting for insects among vegetation, and perhaps gleaning, have very short and rounded wingtips, and often relatively short, broad wings, giving good manoeuvrability at low flight speeds. Many insectivorous species forage by ` flycatching ' (perching while seeking prey) and have somewhat similar morphology to gleaners. Insectivorous species foraging in more open habitats usually have slightly longer wings, and hence lower cost of transport. Piscivores forage over open stretches of water, and have very long wings giving low flight power and cost of transport, and unusually long, rounded tips for control and stability in flight. Carnivores must carry heavy loads, and thus have relatively large wing areas; their foraging strategies consist of perching, hunting and gleaning, and wing structure is similar to that of insectivorous species with similar behaviour. Perching and hovering nectarivores both have a relatively small wing area: this surprising result may result from environmental pressure for a short wingspan or from the advantage of high speed during commuting flights; the large wingtips of these bats are valuable for lift generation in slow flight. The relation between flight morphology (as an indicator of flight behaviour) and echolocation is considered. It is demonstrated that adaptive trends in wing adaptations are predictably and closely paralleled by echolocation call structure, owing to the joint constraints of flying and locating food in different ways. Pressures on flight morphology depend also on size, with most aspects of performance favouring smaller animals. Power rises rapidly as mass increases; in smaller bats the available energy margin is greater than in larger species, and they may have a more generalized repertoire of flight behaviour. Trophic pressures related to feeding strategy and behaviour are also important, and may restrict the size ranges of different feeding classes: insectivores and primary nectarivores must be relatively small, carnivores and frugivores somewhat larger. The relation of these results to bat community ecology is considered, as our predictions may be tested through comparisons between comparable, sympatric species. Our mechanical predictions apply to all bats and to all kinds of bat communities, but other factors (for example echolocation) may also contribute to specialization in feeding or behaviour, and species separation may not be determined solely by wing morphology or flight behaviour. None the less, we believe that our approach, of identifying functional correlates of bat flight behaviour and identifying these with morphological adaptations, clarifies the eco-morphological relationships of bats.},

Only a few natural sensory systems can actively control their field of view (e.g., dolphins, whales, and bats). Bats are known for their active sensing abilities and modify their echolocation signals by actively controlling their spectral and temporal characteristics. Less is known about bats' ability to actively modify their bio-sonar field of view. Results:\hspace{0.6em} We show that Pipistrellus kuhlii bats rapidly narrow their sensory field of view (i.e., their bio-sonar beam) when scanning a target. On-target vertical sonar beams were twofold narrower than off-target beams. Continuous measurements of the mouth gape of free-flying bats revealed that they control their bio-sonar beam by a \textasciitilde 3.6 mm widening of their mouth gape: namely, bats open their mouth to narrow the beam and vice versa. Conclusions:\hspace{0.6em} Bats actively and rapidly control their echolocation vertical beam width by modifying their mouth gape. We hypothesize that narrowing their vertical beam narrows the zone of ensonification when estimating the elevation of a target. In other words, bats open their mouth to improve sensory localization.},

Additionally, we show that laryngeal motor performance, not overlap between call production and the arrival of echoes at the bat's ears, limits maximum call rate. Superfast muscles are rare in vertebrates and always associated with extraordinary motor demands on acoustic communication.

  abstract = {Horseshoe bats emit their biosonar pulses nasally and diffract the outgoing ultrasonic waves by conspicuous structures that surrounded the nostrils. Here, we report quantitative experimental data on the motion of a prominent component of these structures, the anterior leaf, using synchronized laser Doppler vibrometry and acoustic recordings in the greater horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus ferrumequinum). The vibrometry data has demonstrated non-random motion patterns in the anterior leaf. In these patterns, the outer rim of the walls of the anterior leaf twitches forward and inwards to decrease the aperture of the noseleaf and increase the curvature of its surfaces. Noseleaf displacements were correlated with the emitted ultrasonic pulses. After their onset, the inward displacements increased monotonically towards their maximum value which was always reached within the duration of the biosonar pulse, typically towards its end. In other words, the anterior leaf's surfaces were moving inwards during most of the pulse. Non-random motions were not present in all recorded pulse trains, but could apparently be switched on or off. Such switches happened between sequences of consecutive pulses but were never observed between individual pulses within a sequence. The amplitudes of the emitted biosonar pulse and accompanying noseleaf movement were not correlated in the analyzed data set. The measured velocities of the noseleaf surface were too small to induce Doppler shifts of a magnitude with a likely significance. However, the displacement amplitudes were significant in comparison with the overall size of the anterior leaf and the sound wavelengths. These results indicate the possibility that horseshoe bats use dynamic sensing principles on the emission side of their biosonar system. Given the already available evidence that such mechanisms exist for biosonar reception, it may be hypothesized that time-variant mechanisms play a pervasive role in the biosonar sensing of horseshoe bats.},

Firstly, a spectrum reference matrix corresponding to different relative Doppler shift is generated. Then, the matching degree of Doppler signal spectrum and reference matrix is measured by linear correlation coefficient. Finally, the Doppler shift of wideband signals is extracted through matching degree optimization. Simulation results show that the proposed method can extract the Doppler shift characteristics of wideband signals effectively.},

In bats, we argue that high duty cycle (HDC) echolocation was selected for and evolved from low duty cycle (LDC) echolocation because increasing call duty cycle enhanced the ability of echolocating bats to detect, lock onto and track fluttering insects. Most echolocators (most bats and all birds and odontocete cetaceans) use LDC echolocation, separating pulse and echo in time to avoid forward masking. They emit short duration, broadband, downward frequency modulated (FM) signals separated by relatively long periods of silence. In contrast, bats using HDC echolocation emit long duration, narrowband calls dominated by a single constant frequency (CF) separated by relatively short periods of silence. HDC bats separate pulse and echo in frequency by exploiting information contained in Doppler-shifted echoes arising from their movements relative to background objects and their prey. HDC echolocators are particularly sensitive to amplitude and frequency glints generated by the wings of fluttering insects. We hypothesize that narrowband/CF calls produced at high duty cycle, and combined with neurobiological specializations for processing Doppler-shifted echoes, were essential to the evolution of HDC echolocation because they allowed bats to detect, lock onto and track fluttering targets. This advantage was especially important in habitats with dense vegetation that produce overlapping, time-smeared echoes (i.e. background acoustic clutter). We make four specific, testable predictions arising from this hypothesis.},

Wavefront curvature effects are included and the discussion is extended to investigate the effect of oblique truncation, which gives the horn a shape closely similar to that of a typical vertebrate pinna. The effects of higher modes.are discussed qualitatively and the conditions under which these can be neglected are outlined. All horns are shown to act as efficient pressure transformers over only a restricted bandwidth, the limits of which are determined by flare rate and mouth diameter. For a horn with throat area S1 and mouth area S2 the maximum blocked-throat pressure gain is 10log10 (4 S2/S1) decibels; the gain reduces to 0 dB \_at low frequencies and may become negative at very high frequencies. Oblique truncation raises the maximum gain above that of a horn truncated normally with the same minimum throat-to-mouth distance. It also moves the axis of maximum acoustic response away from the geometric axis of the horn towards the normal to the oblique mouth. This shift is large at low frequencies, becomes slightly nega;pefe at mid frequencies, and approaches zero at high frequencies. Use of these results .in the analysis of model auditory systems is outlined.},

Human studies suggest that binaural spectral differences, and spectral peaks and notches in monaural transfer functions, may all provide spatial information. This study examined the acoustic properties of the pallid bat ear to determine directionality, interaural intensity differences, spectral peaks and notches in transfer functions, as well as acoustic gain. The pallid bat is a gleaning bat that uses passive sound localization to find prey, and echolocation for general orientation. It is capable of very accurate passive sound localization, and the primary focus of this study was to determine the spectral cues that might support this localization acuity. Results show that the external ears of this bat create spectral maxima and minima that vary systematically with azimuth and elevation. The monaural spectral cues resemble those reported in humans and cats, and suggest that similar spectral cues are used across taxa. The ears also create robust interaural spectral differences that vary systematically with both sound azimuth and elevation. These monaural and binaural spectral cues may provide the basis for the 1\textdegree{} angular resolution apparent in it this bat's passive sound localization performance.},

  abstract = {As in vision, acoustic signals can be reflected by a smooth surface creating an acoustic mirror image. Water bodies represent the only naturally occurring horizontal and acoustically smooth surfaces. Echolocating bats flying over smooth water bodies encounter echo-acoustic mirror images of objects above the surface. Here, we combined an electrophysiological approach with a behavioral experimental paradigm to investigate whether bats can exploit echo-acoustic mirror images for navigation and how these mirrorlike echo-acoustic cues are encoded in their auditory cortex. In an obstacle-avoidance task where the obstacles could only be detected via their echo-acoustic mirror images, most bats spontaneously exploited these cues for navigation. Sonar ensonifications along the bats' flight path revealed conspicuous changes of the reflection patterns with slightly increased target strengths at relatively long echo delays corresponding to the longer acoustic paths from the mirrored obstacles. Recordings of cortical spatiotemporal response maps (STRMs) describe the tuning of a unit across the dimensions of elevation and time. The majority of cortical single and multiunits showed a special spatiotemporal pattern of excitatory areas in their STRM indicating a preference for echoes with (relative to the setup dimensions) long delays and, interestingly, from low elevations. This neural preference could effectively encode a reflection pattern as it would be perceived by an echolocating bat detecting an object mirrored from below. The current study provides both behavioral and neurophysiological evidence that echo-acoustic mirror images can be exploited by bats for obstacle avoidance. This capability effectively supports echo-acoustic navigation in highly cluttered natural habitats.},

  abstract = {The unique combination of flight and echolocation has opened the nocturnal air space as a rich ecological niche for bats. By analysing echoes of their sonar emissions, bats discriminate and recognize three-dimensional (3-D) objects. However, in contrast to vision, the 3-D information that can be gained by ensonifying an object from only one observation angle is sparse. To date, it is unclear how bats synchronize echolocation and flight activity to explore the 3-D shape of ensonified objects. We have devised an experimental design that allows creating 3-D virtual echo-acoustic objects by generating in real-time echoes from the bat's emissions that depend on the bat's position relative to the virtual object. Bats were trained to evaluate these 3-D virtual objects differing in their azimuthal variation of either echo amplitude or spectral composition. The data show that through a very effective coordination of sonar and flight activity, bats analyse an azimuthal variation of echo amplitude with a resolution of approximately 16 dB and a variation of echo centre frequency of approximately 19\%. Control experiments show that the bats can detect not only these variations but also perturbations in the spatial arrangement of these variations. The current experimental paradigm shows that echolocating bats assemble echo-acoustic object information \textendash{} acquired sequentially in flight \textendash{} to reconstruct the 3-D shape of the ensonified object. Unlike previous approaches, the recruitment of virtual objects allows for a direct quantification of this reconstruction success in a highly controlled experimental approach.},

  abstract = {Bat populations are threatened in many regions of the world, partly due to the loss of foraging and commuting habitats in farmland and declines in insect prey populations caused by agricultural intensification. Given that bats play an important role as bioindicators and in suppressing crop pests, it is crucial to mitigate negative impacts that arise from these threats. In this study we evaluated the richness, quantified at family level, and abundance of bat prey insects in organic vineyards surrounded by three types of adjacent habitat: urban/semi-urban areas, exotic tree plantations, and remnants of native vegetation. The relationship between the abundance of prey and the foraging activity of bats in the vineyards was also examined. Insects were sampled using ultraviolet light traps, located both inside and at the edge of the vineyards. Bat activity was monitored at each site using acoustic recorders. The insect richness was unaffected by the type of adjacent habitat and did not differ between the edge and the interior of the vineyards. In contrast, insect abundance was significantly influenced by the type of adjacent habitat. Vineyards adjacent to native vegetation and exotic tree plantations showed the highest abundances for most insect orders present in the bat diet compared to urban areas. Bat activity was significantly correlated with the abundance of Coleoptera and Lepidoptera, with mixed effects between bat species (negative for Tadarida brasiliensis, positive for Lasiurus varius, Lasiurus villosissimus and Myotis chiloensis). Crop edges adjacent to native vegetation provides important foraging habitat for bats and should therefore be considered in agricultural management. Locating vineyards close to these habitats may promote bat conservation via increased prey insects and may also benefit winegrowers through the ecosystem services provided by insectivorous bats in this crop. Insectivorous bats provide valuable services to agriculture by suppressing crop pests. However, the possibility of toxic metal accumulation in bats with reference to their diet is understudied. We studied the difference in diet and diet-associated heavy metal accumulation in Schneider's leaf-nosed bat (Hipposideros speoris), a species that lives in two discrete habitats (farm and mine) in southern India. Guano samples were collected from respective roost sites during the dry and wet seasons of three consecutive years (2015-2017). Microscopic diet analysis indicated the presence of insects belonging to six orders (Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Diptera, Hymenoptera, Hemiptera, and Homoptera). Irrespective of habitat, the probability of finding each insect order in the bat diet was high during the wet season. Guano samples were screened for six heavy metal residues (Al, Co, Ni, Cr, Pb, and Hg); these residues varied across the sites and seasons. Aluminum was detected at significantly higher ({$\sim$}2.5 \texttimes ) concentrations in mine bats (dry season: 7.03 {$\pm$} 0.60 mg/g and wet season: 7.10 {$\pm$} 1.44 mg/g) compared to farm bats (dry season: 2.52 {$\pm$} 0.40 mg/g and wet season: 3.28 {$\pm$} 0.92 mg/g). Guano contained heavy metals in the following order of concentration: Al, Co, Ni, Cr, Pb, and Hg. Irrespective of seasons, all were found at significantly higher concentrations in guano from mine bats than farm bats. This study, therefore, shows a plausible ``habitat effect'' on heavy metal accumulation in bats. Further, this study sheds light on the potential use of bat guano as a proxy to measure heavy metals that pass through the food web in different environments.},

However, little is known about how bats alter their pulse acoustic characteristics to adapt to an acoustically jamming situation during flight. We investigated echolocation behavior in a bat (Miniopterus fuliginosus) during free flight under acoustic jamming conditions created by downward FM jamming sounds mimicking bat echolocation sounds. In an experimental chamber, the flying bat was exposed to FM jamming sounds with different terminal frequencies (TFs) from loudspeakers. Echolocation pulses emitted by the flying bat were recorded using a telemetry microphone (Telemike) mounted on the back of the bat. The bats immediately (within 150ms) shifted the TFs of emitted pulses upward when FM jamming sounds were presented. Moreover, the amount of upward TF shift differed depending on the TF ranges of the jamming sounds presented. When the TF range was lower than or overlapped the bat's mean TF, the bat TF shifted significantly upward (by 1\textendash 2kHz, Student's t-test, P{$<$}0.05), corresponding to 3\textendash 5\% of the total bandwidth of their emitted pulses. These findings indicate that bats actively avoid overlap of the narrow frequency band around the TF.},

  abstract = {Perception and encoding of object size is an important feature of sensory systems. In the visual system object size is encoded by the visual angle (visual aperture) on the retina, but the aperture depends on the distance of the object. As object distance is not unambiguously encoded in the visual system, higher computational mechanisms are needed. This phenomenon is termed ``size constancy''. It is assumed to reflect an automatic re-scaling of visual aperture with perceived object distance. Recently, it was found that in echolocating bats, the `sonar aperture', i.e., the range of angles from which sound is reflected from an object back to the bat, is unambiguously perceived and neurally encoded. Moreover, it is well known that object distance is accurately perceived and explicitly encoded in bat sonar. Here, we addressed size constancy in bat biosonar, recruiting virtual-object techniques. Bats of the species Phyllostomus discolor learned to discriminate two simple virtual objects that only differed in sonar aperture. Upon successful discrimination, test trials were randomly interspersed using virtual objects that differed in both aperture and distance. It was tested whether the bats spontaneously assigned absolute width information to these objects by combining distance and aperture. The results showed that while the isolated perceptual cues encoding object width, aperture, and distance were all perceptually well resolved by the bats, the animals did not assign absolute width information to the test objects. This lack of sonar size constancy may result from the bats relying on different modalities to extract size information at different distances. Alternatively, it is conceivable that familiarity with a behaviorally relevant, conspicuous object is required for sonar size constancy, as it has been argued for visual size constancy. Based on the current data, it appears that size constancy is not necessarily an essential feature of sonar perception in bats.},

  abstract = {Locomotion and foraging on the wing require precise navigation in more than just the horizontal plane. Navigation in three dimensions and, specifically, precise adjustment of flight height are essential for flying animals. Echolocating bats drink from water surfaces in flight, which requires an exceptionally precise vertical navigation. Here, we exploit this behavior in the bat, Phyllostomus discolor, to understand the biophysical and neural mechanisms that allow for sonar-guided navigation in the vertical plane. In a set of behavioral experiments, we show that for echolocating bats, adjustment of flight height depends on the tragus in their outer ears. Specifically, the tragus imposes elevation-specific spectral interference patterns on the echoes of the bats' sonar emissions. Head-related transfer functions of our bats show that these interference patterns are most conspicuous in the frequency range {$\sim$}55 kHz. This conspicuousness is faithfully preserved in the frequency tuning and spatial receptive fields of cortical single and multiunits recorded from anesthetized animals. In addition, we recorded vertical spatiotemporal response maps that describe neural tuning in elevation over time. One class of units that were very sharply tuned to frequencies {$\sim$}55 kHz showed unusual spatiotemporal response characteristics with a preference for paired echoes where especially the first echo originates from very low elevations. These behavioral and neural data provide the first insight into biosonar-based processing and perception of acoustic elevation cues that are essential for bats to navigate in three-dimensional space.},

Information flow between layers is suggested to enable the SC to mediate goal-directed orienting movements. While most mammals strongly rely on vision for orienting, some species such as echolocating bats have developed alternative strategies, which raises the question how sensory maps are organized in these animals. We probed the visual system of the echolocating bat Phyllostomus discolor and found that binocular high acuity vision is frontally oriented and thus aligned with the biosonar system, whereas monocular visual fields cover a large area of peripheral space. For the first time in echolocating bats, we could show that in contrast with other mammals, visual processing is restricted to the superficial layers of the SC. The topographic representation of visual space, however, followed the general mammalian pattern. In addition, we found a clear topographic representation of sound azimuth in the deeper collicular layers, which was congruent with the superficial visual space map and with a previously documented map of orienting movements. Especially for bats navigating at high speed in densely structured environments, it is vitally important to transfer and coordinate spatial information between sensors and motor systems. Here, we demonstrate first evidence for the existence of congruent maps of sensory space in the bat SC that might serve to generate a unified representation of the environment to guide motor actions.},

All call parameters are highly adaptable and determine the bat's acoustic field of view and hence its perception of the echo scene. The intensity (source level) and directionality of the emitted calls directly contribute to the bat's acoustic field of view; however, the source level and directionality of the big brown bat's sonar signals have not been measured in the field. In addition, for bats, navigation and prey capture require that they process several streams of acoustic information. By using stereotypic flight paths in known areas, bats may be able to reduce the sensory processing load for orientation and therefore allocate echo processing resources to prey. Here we recorded the echolocation calls from foraging E. fuscus in the field with a microphone array and estimated call intensity and directionality, based on reconstructed flight trajectories. The source levels were intense with an average maximum source level of 138 dB (root mean square re. 20 \textmu Pa at 0.1 m). Furthermore, measurements taken from a subset of calls indicate that the echolocation signals in the field may be more directional than estimated in the laboratory (half-amplitude angle 30 deg at 35 kHz). We also observed that E. fuscus appear to follow stereotypic flight paths, and propose that this could be a strategy to optimize foraging efficiency by minimizing the sensory processing load.},

  abstract = {Studying six vespertilionid bat species of different sizes to investigate the reason why smaller bats have higher frequency echolocation calls, a model is put forward that the size/frequency range is modulated by the need to maintain a focused, highly directional echolocation beam. The smaller the bat, the higher the frequency of its echolocation calls. Until now this scaling has been attributed either to the bat's size or to the supposition that smaller bats seeking finer prey will need to use higher frequencies to pick out smaller objects. But that doesn't explain why small bats emit such high-pitched squeaks\textemdash up to 55 kHz, when 20 kHz would do the job, carry farther and take less effort to produce. Annemarie Surlykke and colleagues compare echolocation signals from six species of vespertilionid bat over a fivefold mass range. They show that the size\textendash frequency relationship is governed by the need to maintain a focused, highly directional beam. As sound beams narrow with increasing emitter size and signal frequency, smaller mouths impose a constraint that forces smaller bats to use higher frequencies to achieve a sufficiently narrow beam. Exceptions prove the rule: phyllostomid bats show a much weaker correlation between size and frequency, but they emit sounds through specialized nasal structures, not through the mouth, and noseleaf dimensions do not scale with body size. Most echolocating bats exhibit a strong correlation between body size and the frequency of maximum energy in their echolocation calls (peak frequency), with smaller species using signals of higher frequency than larger ones1,2. Size\textendash signal allometry or acoustic detection constraints imposed on wavelength by preferred prey size have been used to explain this relationship1,3. Here we propose the hypothesis that smaller bats emit higher frequencies to achieve directional sonar beams, and that variable beam width is critical for bats. Shorter wavelengths relative to the size of the emitter translate into more directional sound beams4. Therefore, bats that emit their calls through their mouths should show a relationship between mouth size and wavelength, driving smaller bats to signals of higher frequency. We found that in a flight room mimicking a closed habitat, six aerial hawking vespertilionid species (ranging in size from 4 to 21 g, ref. 5) produced sonar beams of extraordinarily similar shape and volume. Each species had a directivity index of 11 \textsuperscript{\textbackslash circ\$}) and an on-axis sound level of 108 \$\textbackslash pm\$ 4 dB sound pressure level referenced to 20 {$\mu$}Pa root mean square at 10 cm. Thus all bats adapted their calls to achieve similar acoustic fields of view. We propose that the necessity for high directionality has been a key constraint on the evolution of echolocation, which explains the relationship between bat size and echolocation call frequency. Our results suggest that echolocation is a dynamic system that allows different species, regardless of their body size, to converge on optimal fields of view in response to habitat and task.},

  abstract = {The paper reviews current knowledge of intensity and directionality of bat echolocation signals. Recent studies have revealed that echolocating bats can be much louder than previously believed. Bats previously dubbed ``whispering'' can emit calls with source levels up to 110 dB SPL at 10 cm and the louder open space hunting bats have been recorded at above 135 dB SPL. This implies that maximum emitted intensities are generally 30 dB or more above initial estimates. Bats' dynamic control of acoustic features also includes the intensity and directionality of their sonar calls. Aerial hawking bats will increase signal directionality in the field along with intensity thus increasing sonar range. During the last phase of prey pursuit, vespertilionid bats broaden their echolocation beam considerably, probably to counter evasive maneuvers of eared prey. We highlight how multiple call parameters (frequency, duration, intensity, and directionality of echolocation signals) in unison define the search volume probed by bats and in turn how bats perceive their surroundings. Small changes to individual parameters can, in combination, drastically change the bat's perception, facilitating successful navigation and food acquisition across a vast range of ecological niches. To better understand the function of echolocation in the natural habitat it is critical to determine multiple acoustic features of the echolocation calls. The combined (interactive) effects, not only of frequency and time parameters, but also of intensity and directionality, define the bat's view of its acoustic scene.},

  abstract = {Animals using sound for communication emit directional signals, focusing most acoustic energy in one direction. Echolocating bats are listening for soft echoes from insects. Therefore, a directional biosonar sound beam greatly increases detection probability in the forward direction and decreases off-axis echoes. However, high directionality has context-specific disadvantages: at close range the detection space will be vastly reduced, making a broad beam favorable. Hence, a flexible system would be very advantageous. We investigated whether bats can dynamically change directionality of their biosonar during aerial pursuit of insects. We trained five Myotis daubentonii and one Eptesicus serotinus to capture tethered mealworms and recorded their echolocation signals with a multimicrophone array. The results show that the bats broaden the echolocation beam drastically in the terminal phase of prey pursuit. M. daubentonii increased the half-amplitude angle from approximately 40\textsuperscript{\textbackslash circ\$} to approximately 90\textsuperscript{\textbackslash circ\$} horizontally and from approximately 45\textsuperscript{\textbackslash circ\$} to more than 90\textsuperscript{\textbackslash circ\$} vertically. The increase in beam width is achieved by lowering the frequency by roughly one octave from approximately 55 kHz to approximately 27.5 kHz. The E. serotinus showed beam broadening remarkably similar to that of M. daubentonii. Our results demonstrate dynamic control of beam width in both species. Hence, we propose directionality as an explanation for the frequency decrease observed in the buzz of aerial hawking vespertilionid bats. We predict that future studies will reveal dynamic control of beam width in a broad range of acoustically communicating animals.},

Theory developed from acoustics and sonar engineering permits a strong predictive basis for understanding echolocation performance. Call features, such as frequency, bandwidth, duration and pulse interval are all related to ecological niche. Recent technological breakthroughs have aided our understanding of adaptive aspects of call design in free-living bats. Stereo videogrammetry, laser scanning of habitat features and acoustic flight path tracking permit reconstruction of the flight paths of echolocating bats relative to obstacles and prey in nature. These methods show that echolocation calls are among the most intense airborne vocalizations produced by animals. Acoustic tracking has clarified how and why bats vary call structure in relation to flight speed. Bats using broadband echolocation calls adjust call design in a range-dependent manner so that nearby obstacles are localized accurately. Recent phylogenetic analyses based on gene sequences show that particular types of echolocation signals have evolved independently in several lineages of bats. Call design is often influenced more by perceptual challenges imposed by the environment than by phylogeny, and provides excellent examples of convergent evolution. Now that whole genome sequences of bats are imminent, understanding the functional genomics of echolocation will become a major challenge.},

Echolocation might have subsequently been lost in Old World fruit bats, only to evolve secondarily (by tongue clicking) in this family.

All emballonurid bats use a similar type of echolocation call that consists of a central, narrowband component and one or two short, frequency-modulated sweeps. All calls are multi-harmonic, generally with most energy concentrated in the second harmonic. The design of search calls is closely related to habitat type, in particular to distance of clutter. Emballonurid bats foraging in edge space near vegetation and over water used higher frequencies, shorter call durations and shorter pulse intervals compared with species mostly hunting in open, uncluttered habitats. Peak frequency correlated negatively with body size. Regular frequency alternation between subsequent calls was typical in the search sequences of four out of 10 species. We discuss several hypotheses regarding the possible role of this frequency alternation, including species identification and partitioning of acoustic channels. Furthermore, we propose a model of how frequency alternation could increase the maximum detection distance of obstacles by marking search calls with different frequencies.},

We documented free-flying, naturally foraging wild pipistrelles in various habitats using multiflash stereophotography combined with simultaneous sound recordings. Then we reconstructed the bat's flight position in three-dimensional space and correlated it with the corresponding echolocation sequences. In all three species of pipistrelles, signal structure varied substantially. In echolocation sequences of the search phase we found a consistent association of signal types with habitat types. In uncluttered habitats (obstacles more than 5 m from the bat) pipistrelles emitted almost exclusively narrowband signals with bandwidths less than 15 kHz. In cluttered habitats (obstacles less than 5 m from the bat) they switched to signals with bandwidths of more than 15 kHz. Wideband signals were also used when the bats were turning in cluttered and uncluttered spaces and for an instant after turning away from obstacles. Prey detection occured only when the outgoing signal did not overlap with the returning echo from potential prey. The bats also avoided overlap of echoes from potential prey and obstacles. Based on the results of this study, we propose an overlap-free ``window'' within which pipistrelles may detect potential prey and which allows predictions of minimum distances to prey and clutter-producing objects.},

  abstract = {The sensitivity of the echolocating bat, Eptesicus fuscus, to sonar echoes at different time delays after sonar emissions was measured in a two-choice echo detection experiment. Since echo delay is perceptually equivalent to target range, the experiment effectively measured sensitivity to targets at different ranges. The bat's threshold for detecting sonar echoes at a short delay of only 1.0 msec after emissions (corresponding to a range of 17 cm) was 36 dB SPL (peak to peak), but the threshold decreased to 8 dB SPL at a longer delay of 6.4 msec (a range of 1.1 m). Prior research has shown that, at even longer delays (corresponding to ranges of 3 to 5 m), the bat's threshold is in the region of 0 dB SPL. Contractions of the bat's middle ear muscles synchronized with the production of echolocation sounds cause a transient loss in hearing sensitivity which appears to account for the observed echo detection threshold shifts. The bat's echo detection thresholds increase by approximately 11 dB for each reduction in target range by a factor of 2 over the span from 17 cm to 1.1 m. As range shortens, the amplitude of echoes from small targets also increases, by 12 dB for each 2-fold reduction in range. Thus, when approaching a target, the bat compensates for changes in echo strength as target range shortens by changing its hearing threshold. Since this compensation appears to occur in the middle ear, the bat regulates echoes reaching the cochlea to a stable amplitude during its approach to a target such as a flying insect. In addition to this automatic gain control linked to target range, the bat aims its head to track a target's position during approach, thus stabilizing echo amplitude even if the target's direction changes. We hypothesize that the bat's directional emissions, directional hearing, middle ear muscle contractions, and head aim response collectively create a three-dimensional spatial tracking filter which the bat locks onto targets to stabilize echo amplitudes during interception of prey. We further hypothesize that this regulation, which cancels echo amplitude changes caused by the target's changing spatial position, leaves the bat free to observe echo amplitude changes caused by the target's own actions, such as insect wing beats. Elimination of spatially dependent echo amplitude changes removes the cause of potentially troublesome changes in neural response latency and keeps stimulation from echoes in the "tip" region of auditory nerve fiber tuning curves.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

In fact, complex communication may be a feature of the kind of social cognition required for the formation of social alliances, facilitating both partner choice and the execution of coordinated behaviors [3]. As such, a compelling avenue for investigation is what role flexible communication systems play in the formation and maintenance of cooperative partnerships in other alliance-forming animals. Male bottlenose dolphins in some populations form complex multi-level alliances, where individuals cooperate in the pursuit and defense of an important resource: access to females [4]. These strong relationships can last for decades and are critical to each male's reproductive success [4]. Convergent vocal accommodation is used to signal social proximity to a partner or social group in many taxa [5, 6], and it has long been thought that allied male dolphins also converge onto a shared signal to broadcast alliance identity [5, 6, 7, 8]. Here, we combine a decade of data on social interactions with dyadic relatedness estimates to show that male dolphins that form multi-level alliances in an open social network retain individual vocal labels that are distinct from those of their allies. Our results differ from earlier reports of signature whistle convergence among males that form stable~alliance pairs. Instead, they suggest that individual vocal labels play a central role in the maintenance of differentiated relationships within complex nested alliances.},

This variation correlates with the wingbeat cycle. The timing of call emission correlates with call group size. First pulses of groups containing many calls are emitted earlier than first calls in groups with fewer calls or single calls. This suggests that the emission of pulse groups follows a fixed motor pattern where the information gained from the preceding pulse group determines how many calls will be emitted in the next group. Single calls and call groups are centred at the middle of the upstroke. Expiration is indicated by call emission. The pause between groups is centred at the middle of the downstroke and indicates inspiration. The hypothesis that the source level variation could be caused by changes in the subglottic pressure due to the contraction of the major flight muscles is discussed.},

They can rapidly adjust many of their biosonar parameters to optimize sensory acquisition. They dynamically adjust pulse design, pulse duration, and pulse rate within dozens of milliseconds according to the sensory information that is required for the task that they are performing. The least studied and least understood degree of freedom in echolocation is emission beamforming\textemdash the ability to change the shape of the sonar sound beam in a functional way. Such an ability could have a great impact on the bat's control over its sensory perception. On the one hand, the bat could direct more energy into a narrow sector to zoom its biosonar field of view, and on the other hand, it could widen the beam to increase the space that it senses. We show that freely behaving bats constantly control their biosonar field of view in natural situations by rapidly adjusting their emitter aperture\textemdash the mouth gape. The bats dramatically narrowed the beam when entering a confined space, and they dramatically widened it within dozens of milliseconds when flying toward open space. Hence, mouth-emitting bats dynamically adjust their mouth gape to optimize the area that they sense with their echolocation system.},

The cancellation of the nostril and virtual nostril components at a target produces a sharp spectral notch whose frequency location relates to target elevation. This notch can be observed directly from the swept-frequency emission waveform, suggesting cochlear processing capabilities. Physical acoustic principles indicate the design considerations and trade-offs that a bat can accomplish through noseleaf shape and emission characteristics. An experimental model verifies the analysis and exhibits an elevation versus notch frequency sensitivity of approximately 1\textsuperscript{\textbackslash circ\$}/kHz.},

This paper considers two possible mechanisms that each exploit the combination of direct and delayed acoustic paths to achieve more complex emission or sensitivity echolocation patterns. The first is an emission mechanism, in which the protruding noseleaf vibrates to emit sound in both the forward and backward directions, and pinna structures reflect the backward emission to enhance the forward beam. The second is a reception mechanism, which has a direct echo path to the ear canal and a delayed path involving pinna structures reflecting onto the noseleaf and then into the ear canal. A model using Davis' Round-eared Bat illustrates that such direct and delayed acoustic paths provide target elevation cues. The model demonstrates the delayed pinna component can increase the on-axis emission strength, narrow the beam width, and sculpt frequency-dependent beam patterns useful for echolocation.},

Both sound emission and hearing in echolocating bats are directional but not much is known about how bats use ear movements and possibly movements of the sound-emitting structures to scan space. Here, we investigated in a tightly controlled behavioural experiment how Phyllostomus discolor bats employ their echolocation system while being moved through differently structured environments: we monitored and reconstructed both a close-up of the facial structures in 3D, including the motile noseleaf and outer ears, and the sonar-beam of the bat while it was moved along reflectors. Despite the simple linear movement of the bats in the setup, the bats pointed their beam quite variably in azimuth with a standard deviation of about \$\textbackslash pm\$20 deg. This variation arises from yaw-type head rotations. Video analyses show that the bat's noseleaf twitches with every echolocation call. Second, we show that the bat's ears are raised to a rather stereotypical head-centred position with every echolocation call. Surprisingly, P. discolor can adjust the timing and the magnitude of these ear movements to the distance of the reflectors with millisecond precision. Our findings reveal echolocation-specific specialisations as well as general principles of scanning and stabilisation of a directional remote sense. The call-correlated movements of the facial structures may lead to a higher directionality of the echolocation system and may enable the bats to adjust their echo-acoustic gaze to dynamic environments.},

Although most bats separate pulse and echo in time by signalling at low duty cycles (LDCs), almost 20\% of species produce calls at high duty cycles (HDCs) and separate pulse and echo in frequency. HDC echolocators are sensitive to Doppler shifts. HDC echolocation is well suited to detecting fluttering targets such as flying insects against a cluttered background. We used two complementary experiments to evaluate the relative effectiveness of LDC and HDC echolocation for detecting fluttering prey. We measured echoes from fluttering targets by broadcasting artificial bat calls, and found that echo amplitude was greatest for sounds similar to those used in HDC echolocation. We also collected field recordings of syntopic LDC and HDC bats approaching an insect-like fluttering target and found that HDC bats approached the target more often (18.6\% of passes) than LDC bats (1.2\% of passes). Our results suggest that some echolocation call characteristics, particularly duty cycle and pulse duration, translate into improved ability to detect fluttering targets in clutter, and that HDC echolocation confers a superior ability to detect fluttering prey in the forest understory compared with LDC echolocation. The prevalence of moths in the diets of HDC bats, which is often used as support for the allotonic frequency hypothesis, can therefore be partly explained by the better flutter detection ability of HDC bats.},

  abstract = {Animals enhance sensory acquisition from a specific direction by movements of head, ears, or eyes. As active sensing animals, echolocating bats also aim their directional sonar beam to selectively "illuminate" a confined volume of space, facilitating efficient information processing by reducing echo interference and clutter. Such sonar beam control is generally achieved by head movements or shape changes of the sound-emitting mouth or nose. However, lingual-echolocating Egyptian fruit bats, Rousettus aegyptiacus, which produce sound by clicking their tongue, can dramatically change beam direction at very short temporal intervals without visible morphological changes. The mechanism supporting this capability has remained a mystery. Here, we measured signals from free-flying Egyptian fruit bats and discovered a systematic angular sweep of beam focus across increasing frequency. This unusual signal structure has not been observed in other animals and cannot be explained by the conventional and widely-used "piston model" that describes the emission pattern of other bat species. Through modeling, we show that the observed beam features can be captured by an array of tongue-driven sound sources located along the side of the mouth, and that the sonar beam direction can be steered parsimoniously by inducing changes to the pattern of phase differences through moving tongue location. The effects are broadly similar to those found in a phased array-an engineering design widely found in human-made sonar systems that enables beam direction changes without changes in the physical transducer assembly. Our study reveals an intriguing parallel between biology and human engineering in solving problems in fundamentally similar ways.},

  abstract = {Sensory systems perform fitness-relevant functions, and specialized sensory structures allow organisms to accomplish challenging tasks. However, broad comparative analyses of sensory morphologies and their performance are lacking for diverse mammalian radiations. Neotropical leaf-nosed bats (Phyllostomidae) are one of the most ecologically diverse mammal groups; including a wide range of diets and foraging behaviours, and extreme morphological variation in external sensory structures used in echolocation (nose leaf and pinnae). We coupled 3D geometric morphometrics and acoustic field recordings under a phylogenetic framework to investigate the mechanisms underlying the diversification of external sensory morphologies in phyllostomids, and explored the potential implications of sensory morphological diversity to functional outputs and dietary ecology. We found that the nose leaf consists of two evolutionary modules\textemdash spear and horseshoe\textemdash suggesting that modularity enabled morphological and functional diversification of this structure. We found a significant association between some aspects of nose leaf shape and maximum frequency and bandwidth of echolocation calls, but not between pinnae shape and echolocation call parameters. This may be explained by the use of multiple sensory modes across phyllostomids and plasticity of some echolocation call parameters. Species with different diets significantly differed in nose leaf shape, specifically in spear breadth, presence of a midrib, and cupping and anterior rotation of the horseshoe. This may relate to different levels of prey type specificity within each diet. Pinnae shape significantly differed between species that consume non-mobile, non-evasive prey (broad rounded, cupped pinnae) and mobile, evasive prey (flattened pinnae with a sharp tapering apex). This may reflect the use of different sound cues to detect prey. Our results give insight into the morphological evolution of external sensory structures in bats, and highlight new links between morphological diversity and ecology.

  abstract = {Ultrasonic emissions of bats are directional and delimit the echo-acoustic space. Directionality is quantified by the aperture of the sonar beam. Recent work has shown that bats often widen their sonar beam when approaching movable prey or sharpen their sonar beam when navigating through cluttered habitats. Here we report how nose-emitting bats, Phyllostomus discolor, adjust their sonar beam to object distance. First, we show that the height and width of the bats sonar beam, as imprinted on a parabolic 45 channel microphone array, varies even within each animal and this variation is unrelated to changes in call level or spectral content. Second, we show that these animals are able to systematically decrease height and width of their sonar beam while focusing on the approaching object. Thus it appears that sonar beam sharpening is a further, facultative means of reducing search volume, likely to be employed by stationary animals when the object position is close and unambiguous. As only half of our individuals sharpened their beam onto the approaching object we suggest that this strategy is facultative, under voluntary control and that beam formation is likely mediated by muscular control of the acoustic aperture of the bats' nose leaf.},

  abstract = {External ears in mammals direct and enhance perception of sound. In bats, where navigation and foraging are strongly contingent on reception of sound, we would expect correlations between bat external ear morphology and echolocation signal structure, acoustic and aerodynamic properties, and foraging strategies. Using Web search engines, we collected peer-reviewed literature on these relationships, with the aim of summarising the knowledge on these correlations and establishing general form-function patterns. The literature on the relationship echolocation-ear, and foraging strategy was scant (six and ten publications, respectively). Fifteen more examined the aerodynamic properties and 46 the acoustic properties. Because of the complexity of the subject, few attempts exist that examine ear properties (acoustic, aerodynamic, shape) at the same time for more than a few species. The number of species so far examined represents less than 15\% of the total number of species of bats. Although the available information did not allow to propose general patterns of morphological response of external ears to the factors examined, our findings suggested that further analyses of the relationship form-function in bat ears should consider the study of ears as integrated, multivariate morphological entities in which shape, aerodynamic characteristics, and acoustic properties, are an integrated, multivariate whole that ultimately contributes to the bat foraging behaviour.},

  abstract = {Flexible vocal production control enables sound communication in both favorable and unfavorable conditions. The Lombard effect, which describes a rise in call amplitude with increasing ambient noise, is a widely exploited strategy by vertebrates to cope with interfering noise. In humans, the Lombard effect influences the lexical stress through differential amplitude modulation at a sub-call syllable level, which so far has not been documented in animals. Here, we bridge this knowledge gap with two species of Hipposideros bats, which produce echolocation calls consisting of two functionally well-defined units: the constant-frequency (CF) and frequency-modulated (FM) components. We show that ambient noise induced a strong, but differential, Lombard effect in the CF and FM components of the echolocation calls. We further report that the differential amplitude compensation occurred only in the spectrally overlapping noise conditions, suggesting a functional role in releasing masking. Lastly, we show that both species of bats exhibited a robust Lombard effect in the spectrally non-overlapping noise conditions, which contrasts sharply with the existing evidence. Our data highlight echolocating bats as a potential mammalian model for understanding vocal production control.},

  abstract = {Many animal species adjust the spectral composition of their acoustic signals to variable environments. However, the physiological foundation of such spectral plasticity is often unclear. The sourcefilter theory of sound production, initially established for human speech, applies to vocalizations in birds and mammals. According to this theory, adjusting the spectral structure of vocalizations could be achieved by modifying either the laryngeal/syringeal source signal or the vocal tract, which filters the source signal. Here, we show that in pale spear-nosed bats, spectral plasticity induced by moderate level background noise is dominated by the vocal tract rather than the laryngeal source signal. Specifically, we found that with increasing background noise levels, bats consistently decreased the spectral centroid of their echolocation calls up to 3.2 kHz, together with other spectral parameters. In contrast, noise-induced changes in fundamental frequency were small (maximally 0.1 kHz) and were inconsistent across individuals. Changes in spectral centroid did not correlate with changes in fundamental frequency, whereas they correlated negatively with changes in call amplitude. Furthermore, while bats consistently increased call amplitude with increasing noise levels (the Lombard effect), increases in call amplitude typically did not lead to increases in fundamental frequency. In summary, our results suggest that at least to a certain degree echolocating bats are capable of adjusting call amplitude, fundamental frequency and spectral parameters independently.},

Echolocating bats, for example, must frequently perform sonar tasks in the presence of interfering sounds. Numerous studies have documented sound production flexibility in echolocating bats; however, it remains unknown whether noise-induced vocal modifications (NIVMs) mitigate interference effects on echoes or calls. In this study, we leverage echo level compensation behavior of echolocating bats to answer this question. Using a microphone array, we recorded echolocation calls of Hipposideros pratti trained to approach and land on a perch in the laboratory under quiet and noise conditions. We found that H. pratti exhibited echo level compensation behavior during approaching flights, which depended critically on distance to the landing perch. Broadcast noise delayed and affected the rate of echo level compensation in H. pratti. Moreover, H. pratti increased vocalization amplitude, i.e., exhibited the Lombard effect, while also adjusting call duration and bandwidth with increasing noise levels. Quantitative analyses of the data show that H. pratti relies on echo feedback, not vocal feedback, to adjust signals in the presence of noise. These findings provide compelling evidence that NIVMs in echolocating animals and non-echolocating animals operate through different mechanisms.},

So far, only a few studies have assessed the developmental onset of auditory feedback. The Lombard effect, a well-studied audiovocal phenomenon, refers to an increase in vocal loudness of a subject in response to an increase in background noise. Here, we studied the time course of the Lombard effect in developing bats, Phyllostomus discolor. We show that infant bats produced louder vocalizations in noise than in silence at an age of only 2 weeks. In contrast, the infant bats' morphology and vocalizations changed gradually until 2 months of age. Furthermore, we found that the Lombard magnitude, i.e. how much the bats increased their vocal loudness in noise relative to silence, correlated positively with the age of the infant bats. We conclude that the Lombard effect features an early developmental origin, indicating a fast maturation of the underlying neural circuits for audio-vocal feedback.},

This process, termed echolocation, is to a large part governed by the properties of the emitted clicks. Therefore derivation of click source parameters from free-ranging animals is of increasing importance to understand both how toothed whales use echolocation in the wild and how they may be monitored acoustically. This paper addresses how source parameters can be derived from free-ranging toothed whales in the wild using calibrated multi-hydrophone arrays and digital recorders. We outline the properties required of hydrophones, amplifiers and analog to digital converters, and discuss the problems of recording echolocation clicks on the axis of a directional sound beam. For accurate localization the hydrophone array apertures must be adapted and scaled to the behavior of, and the range to, the clicking animal, and precise information on hydrophone locations is critical. We provide examples of localization routines and outline sources of error that lead to uncertainties in localizing clicking animals in time and space. Furthermore we explore approaches to time series analysis of discrete versions of toothed whale clicks that are meaningful in a biosonar context.},

Here, we test the hypothesis that echolocating harbour porpoises cannot resolve and discriminate targets within a clutter interference zone given by their integration time. To do this, we trained two harbour porpoises (Phocoena phocoena) to actively approach and choose between two spherical targets at four varying inter-target distances (13.5, 27, 56 and 108 cm) in a two-alternative forced-choice task. The free-swimming, blindfolded porpoises were tagged with a sound and movement tag (DTAG4) to record their echoic scene and acoustic outputs. The known ranges between targets and the porpoise, combined with the sound levels received on target-mounted hydrophones revealed how the porpoises controlled their acoustic gaze. When targets were close together, the discrimination task was more difficult because of smaller echo time delays and lower echo level ratios between the targets. Under these conditions, buzzes were longer and started from farther away, source levels were reduced at short ranges, and the porpoises clicked faster, scanned across the targets more, and delayed making their discrimination decision until closer to the target. We conclude that harbour porpoises can resolve and discriminate closely spaced targets, suggesting a clutter rejection zone much shorter than their auditory integration time, and that such clutter rejection is greatly aided by spatial filtering with their directional biosonar beam.},

Here, we elucidate the organization of wing innervation in an insectivore, the big brown bat, Eptesicus fuscus. We demonstrate that wing sensory innervation differs from other vertebrate forelimbs, revealing a peripheral basis for the atypical topographic organization reported for bat somatosensory nuclei. Furthermore, the wing is innervated by an unusual complement of sensory neurons poised to report airflow and touch. Finally, we report that cortical neurons encode tactile and airflow inputs with sparse activity patterns. Together, our findings identify neural substrates of somatosensation in the bat wing and imply that evolutionary pressures giving rise to mammalian flight led to unusual sensorimotor projections.},

  abstract = {Since many bat species thrive in densely vegetated habitats, echoes from foliage are likely to be of prime importance to the animals' sensory ecology, be it as clutter that masks prey echoes or as sources of information about the environment. To better understand the characteristics of foliage echoes, a new model for the process that generates these signals has been developed. This model takes leaf size and orientation into account by representing the leaves as circular disks of varying diameter. The two added leaf parameters are of potential importance to the sensory ecology of bats, e.g., with respect to landmark recognition and flight guidance along vegetation contours. The full model is specified by a total of three parameters: leaf density, average leaf size, and average leaf orientation. It assumes that all leaf parameters are independently and identically distributed. Leaf positions were drawn from a uniform probability density function, sizes and orientations each from a Gaussian probability function. The model was found to reproduce the first-order amplitude statistics of measured example echoes and showed time-variant echo properties that depended on foliage parameters. Parameter estimation experiments using lasso regression have demonstrated that a single foliage parameter can be estimated with high accuracy if the other two parameters are known a priori. If only one parameter is known a priori, the other two can still be estimated, but with a reduced accuracy. Lasso regression did not support simultaneous estimation of all three parameters. Nevertheless, these results demonstrate that foliage echoes contain accessible information on foliage type and orientation that could play a role in supporting sensory tasks such as landmark identification and contour following in echolocating bats.},

  abstract = {Foliage echoes could play an important role in the sensory ecology of echolocating bats, but many aspects of their sensory information content remain to be explored. A realistic numerical model for these echoes could support the development of hypotheses for the relationship between foliage properties and echo parameters. In prior work by the authors, a simple foliage model based on circular disks distributed uniformly in space has been developed. In the current work, three key simplifications used in this model have been examined: (i) representing leaves as circular disks, (ii) neglecting shading effects between leaves, and (iii) the uniform spatial distribution of the leaves. The target strengths of individual leaves and shading between them have been examined in physical experiments, whereas the impact of the spatial leaf distribution has been studied by modifying the numerical model to include leaf distributions according to a biomimetic model for natural branching patterns (L-systems). Leaf samples from a single species (leatherleaf arrowwood) were found to match the relationship between size and target strength of the disk model fairly well, albeit with a large variability part of which could be due to unaccounted geometrical features of the leaves. Shading between leaf-sized disks did occur for distances below 50 cm and could hence impact the echoes. Echoes generated with L-system models in two distinct tree species (ginkgo and pine) showed consistently more temporal inhomogeneity in the envelope amplitudes than a reference with uniform distribution. However, these differences were small compared to effects found in response to changes in the relative orientation of simulated sonar beam and foliage. These findings support the utility of the uniform leaf distribution model and suggest that bats could use temporal inhomogeneities in the echoes to make inferences regarding the relative positioning of their sonar and a foliage.},

  abstract = {Adaptive sonar behavior in bats provides a window to echo information processing and perception of complex scenes. Echolocating bats produce ultrasonic vocalizations and receive a cascade of echoes from a single sonar call when the environment contains multiple reflecting sources. Some echoes may return from food and others from obstacles, and the bat must rapidly sort and identify the sources of echo returns to analyze the sonar scene and accurately control its flight. Big brown bats produce frequency modulated sonar signals that change in direction, duration, bandwidth and repetition rate as they inspect objects at different directions and distances. The work presented here will focus on adaptive sonar behavior in bats as they track a selected prey item in the presence of other objects, both obstacles and other prey. Data suggest that echo stream segregation of targets in clutter is supported by finely tuned adaptive sonar signal control.}

  abstract = {Echolocating bats transmit ultrasonic vocalizations and use information contained in the reflected sounds to analyze the auditory scene. Auditory scene analysis, a phenomenon that applies broadly to all hearing vertebrates, involves the grouping and segregation of sounds to perceptually organize information about auditory objects. The perceptual organization of sound is influenced by the spectral and temporal characteristics of acoustic signals. In the case of the echolocating bat, its active control over the timing, duration, intensity, and bandwidth of sonar transmissions directly impacts its perception of the auditory objects that comprise the scene. Here, data are presented from perceptual experiments, laboratory insect capture studies, and field recordings of sonar behavior of different bat species, to illustrate principles of importance to auditory scene analysis by echolocation in bats. In the perceptual experiments, FM bats (Eptesicus fuscus) learned to discriminate between systematic and random delay sequences in echo playback sets. The results of these experiments demonstrate that the FM bat can assemble information about echo delay changes over time, a requirement for the analysis of a dynamic auditory scene. Laboratory insect capture experiments examined the vocal production patterns of flying E. fuscus taking tethered insects in a large room. In each trial, the bats consistently produced echolocation signal groups with a relatively stable repetition rate (within 5\%). Similar temporal patterning of sonar vocalizations was also observed in the field recordings from E. fuscus, thus suggesting the importance of temporal control of vocal production for perceptually guided behavior. It is hypothesized that a stable sonar signal production rate facilitates the perceptual organization of echoes arriving from objects at different directions and distances as the bat flies through a dynamic auditory scene. Field recordings of E. fuscus, Noctilio albiventris, N. leporinus, Pippistrellus pippistrellus, and Cormura brevirostris revealed that spectral adjustments in sonar signals may also be important to permit tracking of echoes in a complex auditory scene.},

  abstract = {Echolocation is an active sensing system that depends upon the dynamic interplay between auditory information processing and adaptive motor control. The echolocating bat produces ultrasonic vocalizations and uses information contained in the returning echoes to build a three-dimensional auditory representation of its surroundings. The timing, bandwidth, and duration of echolocation signals used to probe the environment directly impact the information available to the bat's acoustic imaging system. In turn, the bat's auditory representation of space guides its actions--ear movements, head aim, flight path, and the features of subsequent sonar vocalizations. This talk will summarize the bat's adaptive vocal behavior as it engaged in complex spatial tasks. The bat's 3D flight path was recorded with high-speed stereo IR video; its sonar signals were recorded with a microphone array that permitted reconstruction of the emission pattern. The sonar emission pattern of the big brown bat, Eptesicus fuscus, is directional, but broad enough to collect echo information from objects within a 60-90 deg cone, which would enable simultaneous inspection of objects in the frontal plane. Here, we report that bats encountering a complex environment shifted the direction and distance of their sonar gaze to inspect closely spaced obstacles and targets sequentially.}

  abstract = {Sensory coevolution has equipped certain moth species with passive acoustic defenses to counter predation by echolocating bats.1,2 Some large silkmoths (Saturniidae) possess curved and twisted biosonar decoys at the tip of elongated hindwing tails.3,4 These are thought to create strong echoes that deflect biosonar-guided bat attacks away from the moth's body to less essential parts of their anatomy. We found that closely related silkmoths lacking such hindwing decoys instead often possess intriguing ripples and folds on the conspicuously lobed tips of their forewings. The striking analogy of twisted shapes displayed far from the body suggests these forewing structures might function as alternative acoustic decoys. Here we reveal that acoustic reflectivity and hence detectability of such wingtips is higher than that of the body at ultrasonic frequencies used by hunting bats. Wingtip reflectivity is higher the more elaborate the structure and the further from the body. Importantly, wingtip reflectivity is often considerably higher than in a well-studied functional hindwing decoy. Such increased reflectivity would misdirect the bat's sonar-guided attack toward the wingtip, resulting in similar fitness benefits to hindwing acoustic decoys. Structurally, folded wingtips present echo-generating surfaces to many directions, and folds and ripples can act as retroreflectors that together create conspicuous targets. Phylogenetically, folds and ripples at wingtips have evolved multiple times independently within silkmoths and always as alternatives to hindwing decoys. We conclude that they function as acoustic wingtip decoys against bat biosonar. VIDEO ABSTRACT.},

We compared pinna gain, directionality of hearing and interaural intensity differences (IID) in echolocating and non-echolocating bats, in species using different echolocation strategies and in species that depend upon prey-generated sounds to locate their targets. In the Pteropodidae, two echolocating species had slightly higher directionality than a non-echolocating species. The ears of phyllostomid and vespertilionid species showed moderate directionality. In the Mormoopidae, the ear directionality of Pteronotus parnellii clearly matched the dominant spectral component of its echolocation calls, unlike the situation in three other species. Species in the Emballonuridae, Molossidae, Rhinopomatidae and two vespertilionids that use narrow-band search-phase echolocation calls showed increasingly sharp tuning of the pinna to the main frequency of their signals. Similar tuning was most evident in Hipposideridae and Rhinolophidae, species specialized for flutter detection via Doppler-shifted echoes of high-duty-cycle narrow-band signals. The large pinnae of bats that use prey-generated sounds to find their targets supply high sound pressure gain at lower frequencies. Increasing domination of a narrow spectral band in echolocation is reflected in the passive acoustic properties of the external ears (sharper directionality). The importance of IIDs for lateralization and horizontal localization is discussed by comparing the behavioural directional performance of bats with their bioacoustical features.},

The reciprocity theorem is incorporated into the computational process in order to shorten the computational time, which is otherwise very long. On the other hand, another fast HRTF calculation method for any source position, which is realized by calculating factors independent of the source position in advance, has been suggested by the authors. Using this algorithm, the HRTF for any source position can be obtained in a few seconds with a common PC. The resulting HRTFs are more precise and are calculated faster than those by using the reciprocity theorem. However, speeding the process up even further is required in order to respond to a head movement and rotation or to moving sources during binaural sound reproduction. In this paper, a faster calculation method by incorporating a time domain operation into the authors' previous algorithm is proposed. Additionally, the new formulation, which eliminates the extra computational time in the preprocess, is proposed. This method is shown to be faster than the previous ones, but there are some discrepancies at higher frequencies.},

  abstract = {Echolocating bats listen for weak echoes to navigate and hunt, which makes them prone to masking from background noise and jamming from other bats and prey. As for electrical fish that display clear spectral jamming avoidance responses (JAR), bats have been reported to mitigate the effects of jamming by shifting the spectral contents of their calls, thereby reducing acoustic interference to improve echo-to-noise ratio (ENR). Here, we tested the hypothesis that frequency-modulating bats (FM bats) employ a spectral JAR in response to six masking noise bands ranging from 15 to 90 kHz, by measuring the -3 dB endpoints and peak frequency of echolocation calls from five male Daubenton's bats (Myotis daubentonii) during a landing task. The bats were trained to land on a noise-generating spherical transducer surrounded by a star-shaped microphone array, allowing for acoustic localization and source parameter quantification of on-axis calls. We show that the bats did not employ spectral JAR as the peak frequency during jamming remained unaltered compared with that of silent controls (all P{$>$}0.05, 60.73{$\pm$}0.96 kHz, mean{$\pm$}s.e.m.), and -3 dB endpoints decreased in noise irrespective of treatment type. Instead, Daubenton's bats responded to acoustic jamming by increasing call amplitude via a Lombard response that was bandwidth dependent, ranging from a mean of 0.05 dB/dB (95\% confidence interval 0.04\textendash 0.06 dB/dB) noise for the most narrowband noise (15\textendash 30 kHz) to 0.17 dB/dB (0.16\textendash 0.18 dB/dB) noise for the most broadband noise (30\textendash 90 kHz). We conclude that Daubenton's bats, despite having the vocal flexibility to do so, do not employ a spectral JAR, but defend ENRs via a bandwidth-dependent Lombard response.},

Glossophaga soricina (Pallas, 1766), Anoura caudifer (\'E. Geoffroy, 1818), and Phyllostomus discolor (Wagner, 1843) were frequently observed, videotaped, and mist-netted visiting banana inflorescences. Three approaching strategies on banana inflorescences were performed by bats: hovering (glossophagine species), upside landing (G. soricina), and downside landing (P. discolor). A new feeding behavior that consisted in hovering and licking the nectar that dripped from the distal part of a closed bract was observed for glossophagines. Visits occurred throughout the night (from 18:00 h to 05:00 h). However, activity pattern of nectarivorous bat species was significantly different from the omnivorous bat species, with the formers presenting visiting peaks at 21:00 hs and 23:30 hs, and the second at 23:45 hs and 02:30 hs. Dietary specialization, body size, and foraging behavior are important features that are linked to kind of approaching strategies to flowers and activity period of bats. Although bat visits on M. paradisiaca inflorescences are not reproductively important to banana plant, its nectar is a frequent and abundant food source for bats from the family Phyllostomidae, at least in Southeastern Brazil.},

  abstract = {Recent work from our group demonstrates that two exceptional characteristics of bat biosonar\textemdash bats' extremely high call emission rates and these calls' ultrasonic frequencies\textemdash reflect biomechanical constraints of the vocal apparatus. We hypothesized that smaller bats, with their smaller mouths, emit higher frequencies to achieve sufficiently directional sonar beams, and that variable directionality is critical for bats. We found that six aerial hawking, vespertilionid bat species produced sonar beams of similar shape and volume, and we predict that many bats adjust their acoustic field of view to suit habitat and task. We speculate that sonar beam shape has been an evolutionary constraint on echolocation and explains the bat size-call frequency correlation. During the terminal phase of an aerial hawking attack on an insect, bats produce a ``buzz,'' increasing information update rates by producing {$>$}160 calls/second. We discovered that bats use specialized superfast muscles to power these rapid call rates. We also show that laryngeal motor performance, not call-echo overlap, limits maximum call rate. We suggest that the advantages of rapid auditory updates on prey movement have selected for superfast laryngeal muscle. Taken together, our results provide further evidence that bat biosonar is a dynamic sensory system, a sensory system that allows bats to adjust and optimize their acoustic fields of view and to update their auditory scene at rates {$>$}160 times/second to optimize airborne prey detection and tracking.}

  abstract = {The big brown bat, Eptesicus fuscus, navigates and hunts prey with echolocation, a modality that uses the temporal and spectral differences between vocalizations and echoes from objects to build spatial images. Closely spaced surfaces (``glints'') return overlapping echoes if two echoes return within the integration time of the cochlea ({$\sim$}300\textendash 400 {$\mu$}s). The overlap results in spectral interference that provides information about target structure or texture. Previous studies have shown that two acoustic events separated in time by less than {$\sim$}500 {$\mu$}s evoke only a single response from neural elements in the auditory brain stem. How does the auditory system encode multiple echoes in time when only a single response is available? We presented paired FM stimuli with delay separations from 0 to 24 {$\mu$}s to big brown bats and recorded local field potentials (LFPs) and single-unit responses from the inferior colliculus (IC). These stimuli have one or two interference notches positioned in their spectrum as a function of two-glint separation. For the majority of single units, response counts decreased for two-glint separations when the resulting FM signal had a spectral notch positioned at the cell's best frequency (BF). The smallest two-glint separation that reliably evoked a decrease in spike count was 6 {$\mu$}s. In addition, first-spike latency increased for two-glint stimuli with notches positioned nearby BF. The N               4               potential of averaged LFPs showed a decrease in amplitude for two-glint separations that had a spectral notch near the BF of the recording site. Derived LFPs were computed by subtracting a common-mode signal from each LFP evoked by the two-glint FM stimuli. The derived LFP records show clear changes in both the amplitude and latency as a function of two-glint separation. These observations in relation with the single-unit data suggest that both response amplitude and latency can carry information about two-glint separation in the auditory system of E. fuscus.},

  abstract = {Flutter-detecting foragers require specific adaptations of the transmitter and the receiver of their echolocation systems to detect and evaluate flutter information in the echoes of potential prey. These adaptations include Doppler shift compensation (DSC), which keeps the echo frequency from targets ahead constant at a reference frequency (fref), and an auditory fovea in the cochlea, which results in foveal areas in the hearing system with many sharply tuned neurons with best frequencies near fref. So far, this functional match has been verified only for a very few key species, but is postulated for all flutter-detecting foragers. In this study we determined both, the transmitter and receiver properties within individuals of the Bourret's horseshoe bat (Rhinolophus paradoxolophus), an allometric outlier in the rhinolophid family. Here we show that the transmitter and receiver are functionally matched in a similar way as postulated for all flutter-detecting foragers. The performance of DSC, measured as the ability to keep the echo frequency constant at fref, had a precision similar to that found in other flutter-detecting foragers, and the audiogram showed the characteristic course with a minimum at fref. Furthermore, we show for a rhinolophid bat a variation over time of the coupled resting frequency and fref. Finally, we discuss the tight match between transmitter and receiver properties, which is guaranteed by the link between the foveal areas of the receiver and the audio\textendash vocal control system for DSC.},

  abstract = {Echolocating bats construct an auditory world sequentially by analyzing successive pulse-echo pairs. Many other mammals rely upon a visual world, acquired by sequential foveal fixations connected by visual gaze saccades. We investigated the scanning behavior of bats and compared it to visual scanning. We assumed that each pulse-echo pair evaluation corresponds to a foveal fixation and that sonar beam movements between pulses can be seen as acoustic gaze saccades. We used a two-dimensional 16 microphone array to determine the sonar beam direction of succeeding pulses and to characterize the three dimensional scanning behavior in the common pipistrelle bat (Pipistrellus pipistrellus) flying in the field. We also used variations of signal amplitude of single microphone recordings as indicator for scanning behavior in open space. We analyzed 33 flight sequences containing more than 700 echolocation calls to determine bat positions, source levels, and beam aiming. When searching for prey and orienting in space, bats moved their sonar beam in all directions, often alternately back and forth. They also produced sequences with irregular or no scanning movements. When approaching the array, the scanning movements were much smaller and the beam was moved over the array in small steps. Differences in the scanning pattern at various recording sites indicated that the scanning behavior depended on the echolocation task that was being performed. The scanning angles varied over a wide range and were often larger than the maximum angle measurable by our array. We found that echolocating bats use a ``saccade and fixate'' strategy similar to vision. Through the use of scanning movements, bats are capable of finding and exploring targets in a wide search cone centered along flight direction.},

Using a complex interplay of acoustic cues, the bats perceive object distance from echo delay and object shape from echo spectra. Typical natural targets\textemdash flying insects\textemdash return discrete reflections, called glints, from prominent body parts (e.g., head, wings). Insect sizes are mostly 0.5 cm to about 3.5 cm, corresponding to reflected time separations of 30 to 210 {$\mu$}s. When closely spaced reflections overlap, they interfere to create a characteristic echo spectrum containing repetitive peaks and nulls. Time spacing of these glints ({$\Delta$}t) is transposed into spectral ripples at frequency intervals ({$\Delta$}f = 1/{$\Delta$}t) from about 30 kHz down to 5 kHz. The bat's perception of rippled echoes as a distinct class was tested in two-alternative forced-choice discrimination experiments with a standard stimulus of 100 {$\mu$}s glint separation (10 kHz ripples), in the middle of natural ripple separations (30 kHz to 5 kHz). Stimuli were electronically generated virtual targets with simulated 2-glint sizes from smaller than 0.5 cm to larger than 3.5 cm. Bats perceived insect-sized virtual objects (glint delays of 36\textendash 300 {$\mu$}s) as similar to the 100-{$\mu$}s standard, while smaller or larger virtual objects were perceived as not similar. Insect-sized echoes contained a pattern of microscale spectral ripples that stood apart from the coarser, macroscale spectral features of smaller objects or the temporally separate reflections of larger objects.},

  abstract = {Echolocating bats behave as though they perceive the crosscorrelation functions between their sonar transmissions and echoes as images of targets, at least with respect to perception of target range, horizontal direction, and shape. These data imply that bats use a multi-dimensional acoustic imaging system for echolocation with broadband, usually frequencymodulated signals. The perceptual structure of the echolocation signals used by different species of bats was investigated using the crosscorrelation functions between emitted signals and returning echoes as indices of perceptual acuity. Thebandwidth andaverage period of echolocation signals are identified as the principal acoustic features of broadband sonar waveforms that determine the quality of target perceptions. The multiple-harmonic structure of echolocation sounds, which is characteristic of the broadband signals of the majority of species of bats, yields a lower average period (separation of peaks in the crosscorrelation function) than would be expected from the average frequency of the signal as a whole, sharpening target localization. The frequency-modulation of the harmonics in the sonar sounds of bats reduces the heights of side-peaks in the crosscorrelation functions of the signals, promoting sharp, unambiguous determination of target position, and leads to the well-known coupling of perception of range and velocity for moving targets. The shapes of the frequency sweeps and bandwidths of frequency modulation contribute to reducing this range-velocity coupling. Harmonic organization nearly eliminates range-velocity coupling. The use of multiple-harmonics and fairly broad frequency modulation in sonar signals yields especially sharp resolution of target position to reject clutter interference. Such signals are commonly used by bats in cluttered environments. Very broad frequency sweeps with fewer harmonics may accomplish the same effect, but the low signal periodicity contributed by harmonic structure is an important factor in ``banishing'' side-peaks in the crosscorrelation function from perception.},

  abstract = {Echolocating bats can recognize flying insects as sonar targets in a variety of different acoustic situations ranging from open spaces to dense clutter. Target classification must depend on perceiving images whose dimensions can tolerate intrusion of additional echoes from other objects, even echoes arriving at about the same time as those from the insect, without disrupting image organization. The big brown bat, Eptesicus fuscus, broadcasts FM sonar sounds in the 15\textendash 100 kHz band and perceives the arrival-time of echoes with an accuracy of 10\textendash 15 ns and a two-point resolution of 2 {$\mu$}s, which suggests that perception of fine detail on the dimension of echo delay or target range is the basis for reconstructing complex acoustic scenes and recognizing targets that are embedded in these scenes. The directionality of the bat's sonar sound is very broad, making it impossible to isolate echoes from individual targets merely by aiming the head and ears at one object instead of another. Consequently, segregation of targets must depend on isolating their echoes as discrete events along the axis of delay. That is, the bat's images must correspond to impulse responses of target scenes. However, the bat's sonar broadcasts are several milliseconds long, and the integration time of echo reception is about 350 {$\mu$}s, so perception of separate delays for multiple echoes only a few microseconds apart requires deconvolution of spectrally-complex echoes that overlap and interfere with each other within the 350-{$\mu$}s integration time. The bat's auditory system encodes the FM sweeps of transmissions and echoes as half-wave-rectified, magnitude-unsquared spectrograms, and then registers the time that elapses between each frequency in the broadcast and the echo, effectively correlating the spectrograms. The interference patterns generated by overlap of multiple echoes are then used to modify these delay estimates by adding fine details of the delay structure of echoes. This is equivalent to transformation of the spectrograms into the time domain, or deconvolution of echo spectra by spectrogram correlation and transformation (SCAT). However, while deconvolution overcomes integration time, the bat's receiving antennas reverberate for about 100 {$\mu$}s, smearing the echoes upon arrival. The bat overcomes this problem by receiving echoes from different directions than the transmitted sound, which radiates from the mouth. The broad range of antenna reverberations common to the emission and echoes thus cancel out, leaving only narrow elevation-dependent differences, which in fact appear in the bat's images. The SCAT algorithms successfully recreate images comparable to those perceived by the bat and provide for classification of targets from their glint structure in different situations.},

  abstract = {1.FM echolocating bats (Eptesicus fuscus) were trained to discriminate between a two-component complex target and a one-component simple target simulated by electronically-returned echoes in a series of experiments that explore the composition of the image of the two-component target. In Experiment I, echoes for each target were presented sequentially, and the bats had to compare a stored image of one target with that of the other. The bats made errors when the range of the simple target corresponded to the range of either glint in the complex target, indicating that some trace of the parts of one image interfered with perception of the other image. In Experiment II, echoes were presented simultaneously as well as sequentially, permitting direct masking of echoes from one target to the other. Changes in echo amplitude produced shifts in apparent range whose pattern depended upon the mode of echo presentation.2.Eptesicus perceives images of complex sonar targets that explicitly represent the location and spacing of discrete glints located at different ranges. The bat perceives the target's structure in terms of its range profile along a psychological range axis using a combination of echo delay and echo spectral representations that together resemble a spectrogram of the FM echoes. The image itself is expressed entirely along a range scale that is defined with reference to echo delay. Spectral information contributes to the image by providing estimates of the range separation of glints, but it is transformed into these estimates.3.Perceived absolute range is encoded by the timing of neural discharges and is vulnerable to shifts caused by neural amplitude-latency trading, which was estimated at 13 to 18 {$\mu$}s per dB from N1 and N4 auditory evoked potentials in Eptesicus. Spectral cues representing the separation of glints within the target are transformed into estimates of delay separations before being incorporated into the image. However, because they are encoded by neural frequency tuning rather than the time-of-occurrence of neural discharges, the perceived range separation of glints in images is not vulnerable to amplitudelatency shifts.4.The bat perceives an image that is displayed in the domain of time or range. The image receives no evident spectral contribution beyond what is transformed into delay estimates. Although the initial auditory representation of FM echoes is spectrogram-like, the time, frequency, and amplitude dimensions of the spectrogram appear to be compressed into an image that has only time and amplitude dimensions. The spectral information is not lost but manifests itself as equivalent time-domain information.},

The frequency components are 18\textendash 20 kHz (first harmonic), 36\textendash 40 kHz (second harmonic), 56\textendash 60 kHz (third harmonic), and 75\textendash 80 kHz (fourth harmonic). The second harmonic is the strongest component, with the third harmonic 2 to 10 dB weaker, and the first and fourth harmonics about 10 to 20 dB weaker than the second.The bat's hearing, as indicated by N4 auditory evoked potentials, is moderately sharply tuned to the second harmonic, broadly sensitive to the first harmonic and to lower frequencies, and moderately sensitive to the third and fourth harmonics. The degree of tuning is sufficient to indicate some specialized function for the second harmonic, perhaps in the task of detecting targets at maximum range, since this is the lowest of the strong harmonics and least affected by atmospheric attenuation. These bats probably do not perform the Doppler compensation response even though their hearing is tuned.The pattern of emission of sonar sounds (repetition rate, duration) during interception of prey is similar to that observed in most other species of bats. The signals are emitted at repetition rates of 10\textendash 20/s during the search stage, 20\textendash 40/s during the approach stage, and about 100/s during the terminal stage of the pursuit process.

The onset-time of the long, search-stage sounds and the longer, early approach-stage sounds is more abrupt than for the shorter, late approach-stage and the short terminal-stage sounds. This apparently deliberate transient beginning broadens the signal's bandwidth at the onset relative to the narrower bandwidth prevailing for the rest of the CF harmonic structure which follows. In the shorter sounds, which are emitted during the late approach stage and terminal stage, the onset is more gradual, but the duration (the envelope) and the offset-time are now short enough that the bandwidth of the signal as a whole is increased. The bandwidth is manipulated primarily by these changes in signal envelope and secondarily by the increased FM sweep-width in the terminal stage.Except for duration these signals are relatively inflexible and suggestive of a primitive kind of echolocation in which only one dimension is changed to achieve qualities which most other species of bats obtain by changing a variety of signal dimensions simultaneously. The abrupt signal onsets may be an indication that multiple-harmonic CF and FM echolocation sounds evolved from click-like echolocation sounds of the type emitted byRousettus and some terrestrial mammals.

  abstract = {Echolocating bats perceive objects as acoustic images derived from echoes of the ultrasonic sounds they emit. They can detect, track, identify, and intercept flying insects using sonar. Many species, such as the big brown bat, Eptesicusfuscus, emit frequency-modulated sonar sounds and perceive the distance to targets, or target range, from the delay of echoes. For Eptesicus, a point-target's image has a sharpness along the range axis that is determined by the acuity of echo-delay perception, which is about 10 ns under favorable conditions. The image as a whole has a fine range structure that corresponds to the cross-correlation function between emissions and echoes. A complex target \textemdash{} which has reflecting points, called ``glints'', located at slightly different distances and reflects echoes containing overlapping components with slightly different delays \textemdash{} is perceived in terms of its range profile. The separation of the glints along the range dimension is encoded by the shape of the echo spectrum created by interference between overlapping echo components. However, Eptesicus transforms the echo spectrum back into an estimate of the original delay separation of echo components. The bat thus converts spectral cues into elements of an image expressed in terms of range. The absolute range of the nearest glint is encoded by the arrival time of the earliest echo component, and the spectrally encoded range separation of additional glints is referred to this time-encoded reference range for the image as a whole. Each individual glint is represented by a cross-correlation function for its own echo component, the nearest of which is computed directly from arrival-time measurements while further ones are computed by transformation of the echo spectrum. The bat then sums the cross-correlation functions for multiple glints to form the entire image of the complex target. Range and shape are two distinct features of targets that are separately encoded by the bat's auditory system, but the bat perceives unitary images that require fusion of these features to create a synthetic psychological dimension of range. The bat's use of cross-correlation-like images reveals neural computations that achieve fusion of stimulus features and offers an example of high-level operations involved in the formation of perceptual ``wholes''.},

The energy cost of echolocation in a small (6 g) insectivorous bat, when hanging at rest, was recently measured at 0.067 Joules per pulse3, implying a mean cost for echolocation in flight of 9.5 \texttimes{} basal metabolic rate (range 7 to 12\texttimes ). Because flight is very costly4, whether the costs of echolocation and flying are additive is an important question. We measured the energy costs of flight in two species of small echolocating Microchiroptera using a novel combination of respirometry and doubly-labelled water5. Flight energy expenditure (adjusted for body mass) was not significantly different between echolocating bats and non-echolocating bats and birds. The low cost of echolocation for flying vertebrates may have been a significant factor favouring its evolution in these groups.},

To do this, we have developed a biologging device that can record the primary sensory information and the associated movements during foraging and navigating in echolocating bats. This 2.6-g tag records the sonar calls and echoes from an ultrasonic microphone, while simultaneously sampling fine-scale movement in three dimensions from wideband accelerometers and magnetometers. In this study, we tested the tag on an European noctula Nyctalus noctula during target approaches and on four big brown bats Eptesicus fuscus during prey interception in a flight room. We show that the tag records both the outgoing calls and echoes returning from objects at biologically relevant distances. Inertial sensor data enables the detection of behavioural events such as flying, turning, and resting. In addition, individual wing-beats can be tracked and synchronized to the bat's sound emissions to study the coordination of different motor events. By recording the primary acoustic flow of bats concomitant with associated behaviours on a very fine time-scale, this type of biologging method will foster a deeper understanding of how sensory inputs guide feeding behaviours in the wild.},

The intense echolocation calls of bats are energetically expensive, but their cost can be reduced by synchronizing the exhalations needed to vocalize to wingbeats. Here, we use sound-and-movement recording tags to investigate how wild bats balance efficient sound production with information needs during foraging and navigation. We show that wild bats prioritize energy efficiency over sensory flow when periodic snapshots of the acoustic scene are sufficient during travel and search. Rapid calls during tracking and interception of close prey are decoupled from the wingbeat but are weaker and comprise {$<$}2\% of all calls during a night of hunting. The limited use of fast sonar sampling provides bats with high information update rates during critical hunting moments but adds little to their overall costs of sound production despite the inefficiency of decoupling calls from wingbeats.},

They are studied in bioacoustics and ecoacoustics, with signal processing and analysis an important component. Computational bioacoustics has accelerated in recent decades due to the growth of affordable digital sound recording devices, and to huge progress in informatics such as big data, signal processing and machine learning. Methods are inherited from the wider field of deep learning, including speech and image processing. However, the tasks, demands and data characteristics are often different from those addressed in speech or music analysis. There remain unsolved problems, and tasks for which evidence is surely present in many acoustic signals, but not yet realised. In this paper I perform a review of the state of the art in deep learning for computational bioacoustics, aiming to clarify key concepts and identify and analyse knowledge gaps. Based on this, I offer a subjective but principled roadmap for computational bioacoustics with deep learning: topics that the community should aim to address, in order to make the most of future developments in AI and informatics, and to use audio data in answering zoological and ecological questions.},

The sonar beam of the big brown bat, Eptesicus fuscus, is directional but broad enough to provide audible echo information from within a 60\textendash 90 deg. cone. This suggests that the big brown bat could interrogate a natural scene without fixating each important object separately. We tested this idea by measuring the directional aim and duration of the bat's sonar beam as it performed in a dual task, obstacle avoidance and insect capture. Bats were trained to fly through one of two openings in a fine net to take a tethered insect at variable distances behind the net. The bats sequentially scanned the edges of the net opening and the prey by centering the axis of their sonar beam with an accuracy of {$\sim$}5 deg. The bats also shifted the duration of their sonar calls, revealing sequential sampling along the range axis. Changes in duration and directional aim were correlated, showing that the bat first inspected the hole, and then shifted its gaze to the more distant insect,before flying through the net opening. Contrary to expectation based on the sonar beam width, big brown bats encountering a complex environment accurately pointed and shifted their sonar gaze to sequentially inspect closely spaced objects in a manner similar to visual animals using saccades and fixations to scan a scene. The findings presented here from a specialized orientation system, echolocation, offer insights into general principles of active sensing across sensory modalities for the perception of natural scenes.},

  abstract = {Echolocating bats emit short high-frequency calls and use returning echoes to determine direction, distance, and features of objects in the environment. Thus, echolocation is an active orientation system allowing bats to operate with little or no light. In open areas in the wild, bats emit very high intensity search calls of high directionality to increase the range of the sonar. In cluttered habitats (or the laboratory) not only the prey but also vegetation and other obstacles will reflect a fusion of many echoes for each emitted echolocation call. In cluttered habitats, the intensity is lower and the beam is wider to shorten and broaden the angle of view, while the beam axis is still focused very accurately on the target. Thus, by adjusting intensity, directionality, and beam aim of their calls, bats can actively filter and control the ``sound-picture'' of their surroundings that they perceive through echolocation.}

Equipment has improved dramatically to allow unprecedented level of control also in field experiments. Also, the active acoustic orientation of bats and dolphins provide a unique window into adaptive perception processes, making echolocators attractive models for studies of acoustic scene analysis. Bats and whales comprise almost a fourth of all mammals and the diversity of echolocation signals reflects diversity in habitat and behavior. There are substantial differences between the two groups: (1) Sound production is done by bats in the larynx and by whales with phonic lips in their nasal passages; (2) the media they live in, air and water, differ strongly in density and sound transmission properties; and (3) the sizes of most echolocating bats is less than 100 g, while odontocetes range from 50 to 25,000 kg. However, the similarities of their echolocation are striking: Both bats and whales emit short directional pulses, with most energy in the ultrasonic frequency range below 200 kHz. The outgoing pulse as well as hearing sensitivity are constantly adapted to target range through active motor feedback. Thus, the echolocating bats and whales comprise an extraordinary example of convergent evolution.},

  abstract = {Echolocating bats have successfully exploited a broad range of habitats and prey. Much research has demonstrated how time-frequency structure of echolocation calls of different species is adapted to acoustic constraints of habitats and foraging behaviors. However, the intensity of bat calls has been largely neglected although intensity is a key factor determining echolocation range and interactions with other bats and prey. Differences in detection range, in turn, are thought to constitute a mechanism promoting resource partitioning among bats, which might be particularly important for the species-rich bat assemblages in the tropics. Here we present data on emitted intensities for 11 species from 5 families of insectivorous bats from Panam\'a hunting in open or background cluttered space or over water. We recorded all bats in their natural habitat in the field using a multi-microphone array coupled with photographic methods to assess the bats' position in space to estimate emitted call intensities. All species emitted intense search signals. Output intensity was reduced when closing in on background by 4\textendash 7 dB per halving of distance. Source levels of open space and edge space foragers (Emballonuridae, Mormoopidae, Molossidae, and Vespertilionidae) ranged between 122\textendash 134 dB SPL. The two Noctilionidae species hunting over water emitted the loudest signals recorded so far for any bat with average source levels of ca. 137 dB SPL and maximum levels above 140 dB SPL. In spite of this ten-fold variation in emitted intensity, estimates indicated, surprisingly, that detection distances for prey varied far less; bats emitting the highest intensities also emitted the highest frequencies, which are severely attenuated in air. Thus, our results suggest that bats within a local assemblage compensate for frequency dependent attenuation by adjusting the emitted intensity to achieve comparable detection distances for prey across species. We conclude that for bats with similar hunting habits, prey detection range represents a unifying constraint on the emitted intensity largely independent of call shape, body size, and close phylogenetic relationships.},

The beam width of the calls is central to the function of the sonar, but directionality of echolocation calls has never been measured from bats flying in the wild. We used a microphone array to record sounds and determine horizontal directionality for echolocation calls of the trawling Daubenton's bat, Myotis daubentonii, flying over a pond in its natural habitat. Myotis daubentonii emitted highly directional calls in the field. Directionality increased with frequency. At 40 kHz half-amplitude angle was 25\textsuperscript{\textbackslash circ\$}, decreasing to 14\textsuperscript{\textbackslash circ\$} at 75 kHz. In the laboratory, M. daubentonii emitted less intense and less directional calls. At 55 kHz half-amplitude angle was 40\textsuperscript{\textbackslash circ\$} in the laboratory versus 20\textsuperscript{\textbackslash circ\$} in the field. The relationship between frequency and directionality can be explained by the simple piston model. The model also suggests that the increase in the emitted intensity in the field is caused by the increased directionality, focusing sound energy in the forward direction. The bat may increase directionality by opening the mouth wider to emit a louder, narrower beam in the wild.},

  abstract = {The Neotropical frog-eating bat, Trachops cirrhosus, primarily hunts stationary prey, either by gleaning on the wing, or in a sit-and-wait mode hanging from a perch. It listens passively for prey-generated sounds, but uses echolocation in all stages of the hunt. Like other bats in the family Phyllostomidae, T. cirrhosus has a conspicuous nose leaf, hypothesized to direct and focus echolocation calls emitted from the nostrils. T. cirrhosus is highly flexible in its cognitive abilities and its use of sensory strategies for prey detection. Additionally, T. cirrhosus has been observed to echolocate both with closed and open mouth. We hypothesize that its flexibility extends to echolocation call design. We investigated the effect of hunting mode, perching or flying, as well as the effect of mouth opening, on the acoustic parameters and directionality of the echolocation call. We used a multi-microphone array, a high-speed video camera, and a microphone-diode-video system to directly visualize the echolocation sound beam synchronized with the bat's behavior. We found that T. cirrhosus emits a highly directional sound beam with half amplitude angle (HAM) of 12\textendash 18\textsuperscript{\textbackslash circ\$} and DI (directionality index) of \textbackslash textbackslashtextasciitilde17 dB, among the most directional bat sonar beams measured to date. The directionality was high both when flying and when perching. The emitted intensity was low, around 88 dB SPL at 10 cm from the mouth, when hanging, but higher, around 100 dB SPL at 10 cm, when flying or just before take-off. Our data suggests that the limited search volume of T. cirrhosus sonar beam defined by the high directionality and the rather low intensity of its echolocation calls is adapted to the highly cluttered hunting habitat and to the perch hunting mode.},

In the last decade, there was a tremendous amount of work in developing wearable assistive devices dedicated to the visually impaired people, aiming at increasing the user cognition when navigating in known/unknown, indoor/outdoor environments, and designed to improve the VI quality of life. This paper presents a survey of wearable/assistive devices and provides a critical presentation of each system, while emphasizing related strengths and limitations. The paper is designed to inform the research community and the VI people about the capabilities of existing systems, the progress in assistive technologies and provide a glimpse in the possible short/medium term axes of research that can improve existing devices. The survey is based on various features and performance parameters, established with the help of the blind community that allows systems classification using both qualitative and quantitative measures of evaluation. This makes it possible to rank the analyzed systems based on their potential impact on the VI people life.},

However, the echolocation behavior of bats, including echo information, has not been thoroughly investigated as it is technically difficult to measure all the echoes that reach the bats during flight, even with the conventional telemetry microphones currently in use. Therefore, we attempted to reproduce the echoes received at the location of bats during flight by combining acoustic simulation and behavioral experiments with acoustic measurements. By using acoustic simulation, echoes can be reproduced as temporal waveforms (including diffracted waves and multiple reflections), and detailed echo analysis is possible even in complex obstacle environments. We visualized the spatiotemporal changes in the echo incidence points detected by bats during flight, which enabled us to investigate the ``echo space'' revealed through echolocation for the first time. We then hypothesized that by observing the differences in the ``echo space'' before and after spatial learning, the bats' attentional position would change. To test this hypothesis, we examined how the distribution of visualized echoes concentrated at the obstacle edges after the bats became more familiar with their environment. The echo incidence points appeared near the edge even when the pulse direction was not toward the edge. Furthermore, it was found that the echo direction correlated with the turn rate of the bat's flight path, revealing for the first time the relationship between the echo direction and the bat's flight path. We were able to clarify for the first time how echoes space affects echolocation behavior in bats by combining acoustic simulations and behavioral experiments.},

  abstract = {Echolocating bats perceive their environment by emitting ultrasonic pulses and listening to echoes that are reflected back from their surroundings. Behavioral decisions of bats are mainly dependent on echo information, and acoustical analysis of echoes is useful for understanding their behavioral decisions. To date, echoes have been measured using a telemetry microphone mounted on the bat's head; however, due to technical difficulties, it was not enough to measure all the echoes reaching the bats in flight. In this paper, we propose an approach to reconstruct the echoes of bats in flight using finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) method simulations based on the measured flight path, speed, and sound information from behavioral experiments. As a result, echoes from any target in flight can be correctly reconstructed, including the Doppler effect. We also analyzed the spatiotemporal transition among attended walls for Doppler shift compensation (DSC) during circling flight in the context of DSC behavior and found that the bats switch their attention to different walls and focus on the wall ahead of them in the direction of flight.},

In contrast, the cue for elevation is based on patterns of the broadband power spectra at each ear that result from the direction-dependent acoustic filtering properties of the head and pinnae. Although the exact form of this ``spectral shape'' cue is unknown, most attention has been directed toward a prominent direction-dependent energy minimum, or ``notch,'' because its location in frequency, for both humans and cats, moves predictably from low to high as a source is moved from low to high elevations. However, there is little direct evidence that these spectral notches are important elevational cues in animals other than humans. Here we demonstrate a striking illusion in the localization of sounds in elevation by cats using stimulus configurations that elicit summing localization and the precedence effect that can be explained by spectral shape cues.},

One is a direct method and the other is a convolution method. The formulations and numerical experiments are made for the two-dimensional sound field, and the accuracy of two proposed methods is compared. It is confirmed that both methods can be applied to the moving sound source and receiver including the Doppler effect, and that two methods have the almost same accuracy. It is found that the convolution method has an advantage that the source waveform and the moving speed can be freely changed at the time of convolution when either the source or receiver is stationary.},

Echolocation pulses contain two prominent down-sweeping harmonics (FM1, {$\sim$}55\textendash 22 kHz; FM2, {$\sim$}100\textendash 55 kHz), which are affected differently by propagation to the target and back to the bat. Previous work demonstrates that big brown bats utilize the low frequencies in FM1 for target ranging, while FM2 only contributes if FM1 is also present. The present experiments test the hypothesis that the bat's ability to discriminate echo amplitude is also affected by selectively attenuating FM1 or FM2 in target or nontarget echoes. Bats were trained to perform an amplitude discrimination task with virtual echo targets located 83 cm away. Echo delay was fixed and echo amplitude was varied, while either FM1 or FM2 was attenuated by highpass or lowpass filtering. Bats' performance decreased when lower frequencies were attenuated in target echoes and when higher frequencies were attenuated in nontarget echoes. Performance was reversed in the opposite filtering conditions. The bat's ability to distinguish between virtual targets varying in amplitude at the same simulated range indicates a high level of focused attention for perceptual isolation of target from non-target echoes.},

Critically, in contrast to previous work, our model incorporates bats' ability to execute rapid saccadic scanning motions keeping the prey within its field of view. Decoupling the flight direction from the gaze direction allows our model to capture erratically moving prey using reactive control. We conclude that the rapid shifts in gaze direction allow bats to deal with the narrow field of view provided by their sonar system.},

To our knowledge, the exact role of these appendages has not been thoroughly investigated as for no single species both the hearing and the emission spatial sensitivities have been obtained. In this paper, we set out to evaluate the complete spatial sensitivity of two species of New World leaf-nosed bats: Micronycteris microtis and Phyllostomus discolor. From an ecological point of view, these species are interesting as they belong to the same family (Phyllostomidae) and their noseleaves are morphologically similar. They differ vastly in the niche they occupy. Comparing these species allows us to relate differences in function of the noseleaf to the ecological background of bat species. We simulate the spatial sensitivity of both the hearing and the emission subsystems of two species, M. microtis and P. discolor. This technique allows us to evaluate the respective roles played by the noseleaf in the echolocation system of these species. We find that the noseleaf of M. microtis focuses the radiated energy better and yields better control over the emission beam. From the evidence presented we conclude that the noseleaves serve quantitatively different functions for different bats. The main function of the noseleaf is to serve as an energy focusing mechanism that increases the difference between the reflected energy from objects in the focal area and objects in the periphery. However, despite the gross morphological similarities between the noseleaves of the two Phyllostomid species they focus the energy to a different extent, a capability that can be linked to the different ecological niches occupied by the two species.},

  abstract = {Bats are highly specialized mammals \textemdash{} they can all fly, and many use echolocation to communicate and find prey. Work on a primitive fossil bat Onychonycteris finneyi suggested that although it could fly, it would not have been able to echolocate. Now a microcomputed tomography study of 26 bat species shows that in bats that use larynx-generated clicks to echolocate, the stylohyal bone in the throat is connected to the tympanic bone in the ear region of the skull. This condition is found in Onychonycteris, once again reopening basic questions about the timing and the origin of flight and echolocation in the early evolution of bats. Echolocation is usually associated with bats. Many echolocating bats produce signals in the larynx, but a few species produce tongue clicks. Here, studies show that in all bats that use larynx-generated clicks, the stylohyal bone is connected to the tympanic bone. Study of the stylohyal and tympanic bones of a primitive fossil bat indicates that this species may have been able to echolocate, despite previous evidence to the contrary, raising the question of when and how echolocation evolved in bats. Echolocation is an active form of orientation in which animals emit sounds and then listen to reflected echoes of those sounds to form images of their surroundings in their brains1. Although echolocation is usually associated with bats, it is not characteristic of all bats2,3. Most echolocating bats produce signals in the larynx, but within one family of mainly non-echolocating species (Pteropodidae), a few species use echolocation sounds produced by tongue clicks4,5. Here we demonstrate, using data obtained from micro-computed tomography scans of 26 species (n = 35 fluid-preserved bats), that proximal articulation of the stylohyal bone (part of the mammalian hyoid apparatus) with the tympanic bone always distinguishes laryngeally echolocating bats from all other bats (that is, non-echolocating pteropodids and those that echolocate with tongue clicks). In laryngeally echolocating bats, the proximal end of the stylohyal bone directly articulates with the tympanic bone and is often fused with it. Previous research on the morphology of the stylohyal bone in the oldest known fossil bat (Onychonycteris finneyi) suggested that it did not echolocate6, but our findings suggest that O. finneyi may have used laryngeal echolocation because its stylohyal bones may have articulated with its tympanic bones. The present findings reopen basic questions about the timing and the origin of flight and echolocation in the early evolution of bats. Our data also provide an independent anatomical character by which to distinguish laryngeally echolocating bats from other bats.},

Microchiropteran species whose calls consist of a single, constant frequency harmonic (i.e., some species in the families Rhinolophidae and Hipposideridae) may create additional acoustic localization cues via vigorous pinna movements. In this work, two types of echolocation cues generated by moving a pair of receivers aboard a model sensor head are investigated. In the first case, it is supposed that a common 3-D echolocation principle employed by all bats is the creation of alternative viewing perspectives, and that constant frequency (CF) echolocators use pinna movement rather than morphology to alter the acoustic axes of their perceptual systems. Alternatively, it is possible rhinolophids and hipposiderids move their ears to create dynamic cues\textendash in the form of frequency and amplitude modulations\textendash which vary systematically with target elevation. Here the use of binaural and monaural timing cues derived from amplitude modulated echo envelopes are investigated. In this case, pinna mobility provides an echolocator with a mechanism for creating dramatic temporal cues for directional sensing which, unlike interaural timing differences, do not degrade with head size.},

The auditory analysis of the echoes of their ultrasonic sounds requires a detailed comparison of the emission and echoes. Here an auditory model of bat sonar is introduced and evaluated against a set of psychophysical phantom-target, echo-acoustic experiments. The model consists of a relatively detailed simulation of auditory peripheral processing in the bat, Phyllostomus discolor, followed by a functional module consisting of a strobed, normalised, autocorrelation in each frequency channel. The model output is accumulated in a sonar image buffer. The model evaluation is based on the comparison of the image-buffer contents generated in individually simulated psychophysical trials. The model provides reasonably good predictions for both temporal and spectral behavioural sonar processing in terms of sonar delay-, roughness, and phase sensitivity and in terms of sensitivity to the temporal separations in two-front targets and the classification of spectrally divergent phantom targets.},

  abstract = {Spatially guided behaviors in echolocating bats depend upon the dynamic interplay between auditory information processing and adaptive motor control. The bat produces ultrasonic signals and uses information contained in the returning echoes to determine the direction and distance of objects in space. With this acoustic information, the echolocating bat builds a 3-D auditory representation of the world, which it uses to guide a suite of coordinated motor behaviors, including head and pinna movements, as well as the timing, duration, frequency characteristics, and directionality of sonar signals. Adaptive echolocation behaviors shape the acoustic information available to the bat's sonar imaging system and provide a window to its perception of complex scenes. In a complex environment, an echolocating bat encounters multiple reflecting surfaces that return a cascade of echoes from each sonar transmission. The work presented here will focus on adaptive echolocation behaviors of the big brown bat as it tracks a selected prey item in the presence of multiple objects, both obstacles and other prey. Data suggest that bats can successfully segregate streams of echoes from closely spaced objects through finely tuned adaptive sonar signal control.},

We found that hanging H. pratti had the best hearing sensitivity of approximately 0 dB sound pressure level (SPL) in the PL task but much lower hearing sensitivity (nearly 40 dB worse) in the echo task. In the AL task, all bats gradually increased call frequency by 0.8\textendash 1.1 kHz, which improved their hearing sensitivity by 25\textendash 29 dB.

  abstract = {Many animals have evolved adept sensory systems that enable dexterous mobility in complex environments. Echolocating bats hunting in dense vegetation represent an extreme case of this, where all necessary information about the environment must pass through a parsimonious channel of pulsed, 1D echo signals. We have investigated whether certain bats (rhinolophids and hipposiderids) actively create Doppler shifts with their pinnae to encode additional sensory information. Our results show that the bats' active pinna motions are a source of Doppler shifts that have all attributes required for a functional relevance: (i) the Doppler shifts produced were several times larger than the reported perception threshold; (ii) the motions of the fastest moving pinna portions were oriented to maximize the Doppler shifts for echoes returning from the emission direction, indicating a possible evolutionary optimization; (iii) pinna motions coincided with echo reception; (iv) Doppler-shifted signals from the fast-moving pinna portion entered the ear canal of a biomimetic pinna model; and (v) the time-frequency Doppler shift signatures were found to encode target direction in an orderly fashion. These results indicate that instead of avoiding or suppressing all self-produced Doppler shifts, rhinolophid and hipposiderid bats actively create Doppler shifts with their own pinnae. These bats could hence make use of a previously unknown nonlinear mechanism for the encoding of sensory information, based on Doppler signatures. Such a mechanism could be a source for the discovery of sensing principles not only in sensory physiology but also in the engineering of sensory systems.},

However comprehensive, multi-species studies regarding phyllostomid echolocation are scarce in the literature despite abundant ecological research. In this study, we describe the call structure and interspecific variation in call design of 40 sympatric phyllostomid species from the Central Brazilian Amazon, focussing on general patterns within genera, subfamilies and between feeding guilds. All but one species utilized short, broadband FM calls consisting of multiple harmonics. As reported for other bat families, peak frequency was negatively correlated with body mass and forearm length. Twenty-five species alternated the harmonic of maximum energy, principally between the second and third harmonic. Based on PCA, we were unable to detect any significant differences in echolocation call parameters between genera, subfamilies or different feeding guilds, confirming that acoustic surveys cannot be used to reliably monitor these species. We present Ametrida centurio as an exception to this generalized phyllostomid structure, as it is unique in producing a mono-harmonic call. Finally, we discuss several hypotheses regarding the evolutionary pressures influencing phyllostomid call structure.},

Instead, the bats pointed the main lobe of their sonar beam off-axis. Bats approaching the target emitted sounds to the left and right of its localization, in an alternating manner, so that the maximum slope of the change in intensity of the sonar beam was often positioned close to the target. This echolocation strategy is ideal for target localization but occurs at the cost of target detection.                        ,              Echolocating Egyptian fruit bats do not center their sonar clicks on a target, thereby maximizing localization of the target.           ,              Is centering a stimulus in the field of view an optimal strategy to localize and track it? We demonstrated, through experimental and computational studies, that the answer is no. We trained echolocating Egyptian fruit bats to localize a target in complete darkness, and we measured the directional aim of their sonar clicks. The bats did not center the sonar beam on the target, but instead pointed it off axis, accurately directing the maximum slope (``edge'') of the beam onto the target. Information-theoretic calculations showed that using the maximum slope is optimal for localizing the target, at the cost of detection. We propose that the tradeoff between detection (optimized at stimulus peak) and localization (optimized at maximum slope) is fundamental to spatial localization and tracking accomplished through hearing, olfaction, and vision.},

This nasal emission coincides with the presence of intricately shaped baffle structures surrounding the nostrils. Some prior experimental evidence indicates that these ``noseleaves'' have an effect on the shape of the animals' radiation patterns. Here, we present a numerical acoustical analysis of the noseleaf of a horseshoe bat species. We show that all three distinctive parts of its noseleaf (``lancet," ``sella," ``anterior leaf'') have an effect on the acoustic near field as well as on the directivity pattern. Furthermore, we show that furrows in one of the parts (the lancet) also exert such an influence. The underlying physical mechanisms suggested by the properties of the estimated near field are cavity resonance, as well as reflection and shadowing of the sound waves emitted by the nostrils. In their effects on the near field, the noseleaf parts showed a tendency toward spatial partitioning with the effects due to each part dominating a certain region. However, interactions between the acoustic effects of the parts were also evident, most notably, a synergism between two frequency-dependent effects (cavity resonance and shadowing) to produce an even stronger frequency selectivity.},

Foliage echoes in some cases can help bats gather information about the environment, whereas in others may generate clutter that can mask prey echoes during foraging. It is therefore important to study foliage echoes and their role in bat's sensory ecology. In our prior work, a foliage echo simulator has been developed; simulated echoes has been compared with field recordings using a biomimetic sonar head. In this work, we improve the existing simulator by allowing more flexible experimental setups and enabling a closer match with the experiments. Specifically, we add additional features into the simulator including separate directivity patterns for emitter and receiver, the ability to place emitter and receiver at distinct locations, and multiple options to orient the foliage to mimic natural conditions like strong wind. To study how accurately the simulator can replicate the real echo-generating process, we compare simulated echoes with experimental echoes measured by ensonifying a single leaf across four different species of trees. We further extend the prior work on estimating foliage parameters to estimating a map of the environment.},
