Science is an incredibly creative venture. In discovering the facts about the nature of things and beings, the thoughtful researcher often embarks upon a journey of self-discovery and philosophical realisations that shape the inner voice and guide the journey. And what a journey that is!

As a student of science, one learns much from the published works. As tempting as the front end of science might look from reading the finished product, the whole story seldom gets told. I discovered how different the backstage is from the show once I started my doctorate. It is different in many fascinating ways. It's a story of learning, making those insightful breakthroughs, beginning to see how the ideas shape and connect, the story of nervous anticipation about results and analyses, the great pleasure of something working, and finally! Sometimes, only to soon realise that it should not have worked. The journey taught me to shed emotional attachment to ideas and be comfortable being wrong. Such fascinating is the process that the final product, no matter where it gets published, doesn't do justice to the experience. I want to share that experience to show those who follow the path that the pain and struggles are part of the process and the goals are worth pursuing. 

The creative expanse at a researcher's disposal is endless, limited only by their imagination and time. As an early career scientist, I often feel overwhelmed by the stream of ideas and an urge to pursue them all. It's impractical, but the hope may not be lost. The marvel of the connected world makes it possible to at least share those ideas with the world, which is a relief. 

Thus came this website, a simple platform to share without the bells and the tunes of social media. Since it's not a commercial product, and there is no pressure to gain attention, this website might be among the most boring you might have ever visited. That's alright, though - it's by design. 

I aim to write as often as possible, posting about ideas, projects, techniques I work with and develop, insights derived from reading and brainstorming with colleagues, and prospects for my scientific career.
