## Cook Lentils

Add lentils into about 400ml of water and start the heat. 

Add chopped onions, tomatoes, potato, garlic and cloves to the pot and boil on medium flame. Add some salt.

Take care of the foaming. Keep stirring to avoid overflow.

Keep on a low flame once the foam starts to appear.

Add tamarind and turmeric when the mixture starts boiling. Boil until the lentils are soft.

Use a masher or beater to mix the boiled lentils with vegetables. The mixture must appear smooth and consistent.

## Make Tadka
Heat oil on medium flame.

Add black grams, cumin and mustard seeds. Fry for about two minutes, without burning.

Add curry leaves. If the leaves are fresh, the oil will splatter, use a top for safety.

Add dried red chilies and asafoetida and fry. 

Keep on low for a minute and turn off the heat. Let it sit warm until ready to be mixed.
