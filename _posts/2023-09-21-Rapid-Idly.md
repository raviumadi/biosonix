Idly is among the most typical of the southern states of India. Idlies are made of sourdough consisting of soaked ground rice and black grams. The dough ferments naturally and produces a delicious sweet-sour batter. However, that recipe takes a lot of time and effort.

Fortunately, some more straightforward recipes come in handy when in a hurry. Here is one that works very well and comes close to the taste of the original. Thanks, Mom <3

## Ingredients
- Refined very fine-grain semolina - 150g
- Curds/Natural Yogurt - 100g
- Baking powder
- Salt 

If you are in Germany, the Weichweizen Griess from any grocery store works very well. The preparation in the pictures was made with it.

## Make the Batter
- Get the idly cooker running hot as you make the batter
- Mix the semolina with the yoghurt
- Add a little bit of water if the mix is too thick. Mix thoroughly
- Keep for five minutes
- Mix a pinch of salt and about 0.5g of baking powder/soda with a few drops of water and add to the mixture
- Add the mixture to the oil-smeared idly cooker moulds, level flat with gentle taps

## Steam Cook

- Transfer the moulds to the cooker
- Steam cook for 10 minutes
- When ready, the batter in the moulds must raise and feel firm to the touch.
