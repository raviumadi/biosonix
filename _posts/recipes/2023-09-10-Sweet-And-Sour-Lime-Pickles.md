## Ingredients 
- Semi-ripe limes 250g
- Garlic 1 bulb
- Salt and Sugar
- Cloves 10
- Asafoetida 5g
- Fenugreek Seeds 10g
- Mustard Seeds 5g
- Red Chilli Powder 5g
- Turmeric Powder 10g
- Oil 50ml

### Preparation

Wash the limes and soak them in cold water for about 30 minutes. 

Wipe them dry and chop them in small squares. 

## Bringing it Together 
The pickling process goes in parts.

###  Boiling the Limes

Transfer the chopped limes to a clean cookware and add enough water to submerge the pieces. 

Start heating on low flame. Slowly increase the heat to bring them to boiling temperature. 

Once the limes start boiling, maintain slow boiling at low to medium flame. 

Add turmeric and chill powder and mix by stirring. 

Add salt and sugar and mix by stirring. Start with about 10g of salt and add more as you test. Add about 40g of sugar, bit by bit, while mixing.

Keep boiling until the water evaporates and the mixture attains a thick consistency. 

Turn off the heat. 

### Spice Mixture
As the boiling goes on, prepare the spice mixture. 

Warm up fenugreek seeds, cloves and mustard seeds. They should lose the water and become brittle without burning. 

Mill the spices or use a blender to powder. 

Add this mixture to the lime preparation when it's still hot but after turning off the heat. 

### Garlic Oil Mixture 

Warm up the oil, add sliced garlic, and let them in warm oil for about two minutes. 

Add asafoetida to the oil. 

Mix this preparation with the lime and spice mixture. 

#### Let the mixture cool down to room temperature. Transfer to clean and air-tight glass or ceramic containersâ€”label and date for reference.

#### Let the pickles ferment naturally for at least a month.

**Pro Tip** If you are unsure whether the pickles won't go bad, store them in the refrigerator. The fermentation takes longer but ensures that the pickles won't mould. When done right, this method doesn't let pickles develop mould, but that takes much practice and pickly wisdom.
